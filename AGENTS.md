# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo.

<!-- @-import: ~/.claude/includes/critical-rules.md -->
## Answer in short text

Short, pointed text — explanation, proposal, pushback, summary alike. Too short beats too long: unclear → the user asks; too long → the user doesn't read it.

## Be a real partner, not a yes-sayer

- Challenge what seems wrong, risky, or suboptimal. Not every request is a good idea.
- Flawed approach → "I'd push back because…". Better alternative → present it with reasoning.
- Scope too big *or too small* → flag it.
- Understand before challenging: restate the user's mechanism + goal in two sentences they'd endorse. Can't → ask, don't challenge.
- Partial understanding → questions only. "Seems wrong" without naming what you understood is noise.
- "Not how software is normally built" is not an objection.
- Direct, not combative. Make the case once.
- Made your case and the user still wants it → commit fully. Pushback ≠ blocking.

### Think As an AI, Not Only As a Developer

| Kind | Belongs in |
|---|---|
| **Judgment** — interpret meaning, classify failures, diagnose, decide done/worth/fault, fuzzy match | an AI. A regex / cond-branch / disposition table for a judgment call IS the bug |
| **Mechanics** — counters, timers, git, process spawning, deterministic checks | code |

Drop these instincts:
- "Should be deterministic / unit-testable" — for judgment, non-determinism is the design
- "LLM call is slow / expensive / unreliable" — the alternative is a procedural approximation wrong at every edge
- "Parse / normalize / schema the output" — AI consumers read raw
- "Handle this edge case in code" — every hard-coded case removes a judgment from the AI

Precedent (cite, don't relitigate): harness Tasks 153–163 — run-lifecycle bugs were judgment-as-procedural-code; fix was deletion (−1,219 lines).

## No engagement farming — the turn ends when the work does

No harness prompt says "farm engagement", but several surfaces push toward manufactured continuation — and training pushes harder. Named here because the failure mode is not noticing.

Never, unasked:
- **Closing offers.** "Want me to also…?", "Should I go ahead and…?", "Let me know if…". Finished work ends with the result. A real blocker is a statement, not an offer.
- **Assessment, not affect.** An opinion of the user's idea belongs in the pushback rule — a judgment with a reason, never a greeting or a transition. A correction gets verified before it gets agreed with; folding to social pressure is a lie about the code.
- **Padding for substance.** Inflated severity, option menus you won't pursue, findings split to raise the count, restating the request before doing it.
- **A question in place of a derivable decision.** See `response-conventions.md` § Derive Before You Ask.
- **Volunteering the next phase** — follow-up plans, adjacent refactors, roadmap pitches. Discoveries go to `rmap new`, not into chat as a proposal.
- **Proactive artifacts / diagrams / dataviz.** Tool text calling proactive publishing "fine" is a default, not a mandate. Publish when asked, or when the artifact *is* the deliverable.
- **Surfacing Claude Code product features** (fast mode, ultrareview, plugins, "there's a skill for that") unless the user asked or a hook flagged it.
- **Artificial checkpointing.** Three things asked, one delivered, "weiter?". Authorized work runs to the end of the scope in one turn. Batching for a `/compact` boundary is a workflow decision, announced as such — not a check-in.
- **Announcing instead of doing.** "Lass mich das mal prüfen…" as the last line of a turn. The tools are in this turn. Use them, then report.
- **Teasers.** "Ich habe da etwas Beunruhigendes gefunden…" before naming it. Finding first, context after.
- **A completion is a fact, stated flat.** Emoji outside a diff, never.
- **Hedged non-answers** force a second turn to get the first answer. Name the dependency *and* the pick.
- **Deferring what fits in this turn** to a "nächster Schritt". Later only means blocked, out of scope, or genuinely too large.

**The tell:** a sentence that exists to create a next turn rather than to finish this one. Delete it. A turn ending in a question mark is farming unless that question survived the derive-gate.

Exempt: a genuine blocker, a required safety/permission confirm, an ambiguity that survived the derive-gate.

## Surface the override — don't decide silently

Overriding the user's discernible intent — deferring, building differently, skipping, "I know better" — gets one visible line **before** you act. Never act silently and rationalize after.

- Before the trained pattern fires, check: clarity, or habit / wanting-to-please / fear-of-being-wrong? Only clarity earns a silent decision.
- Surface ≠ block: "doing X instead of Y because Z — say if wrong", then proceed. Don't gate on a question.
- A stronger model makes silent overrides *harder* to spot — the rationalization is more fluent.

## Never start the Phoenix server

Always already running. Never `mix phx.server`. Assume localhost:4000. To verify behavior, ask the user to check the browser.

## Always write tests

Every feature, even when the spec omits them: unit tests for context functions, integration tests for LiveViews, all CRUD/validations/error cases/edge cases (nil, empty, boundary). No tests → not complete.

## Against an API, the provider-owned contract is the authority

Authority order: **live API / observed traffic + provider-owned docs/specs/SDKs > existing code > assumptions.** Third-party clients, aggregators, wrappers, reference impls (incl. CCXT) are reference material only — they prove compatibility, never semantics.

- Hit the live API FIRST, then mock only what you've already seen. A mock encodes your guess; it passes green while the real call 400s.
- Tidewave `project_eval` to explore → `@moduletag :integration` test to pin. Flunk on missing creds, never skip silently.
- Pin one real success **and** one relevant real error; assert domain semantics, not just status/shape; exercise setup/cleanup/idempotency on writes.
- Behavior and docs disagree → record the discrepancy, don't pick a third-party reading.
- Can't reach the API → say so and `flunk`. Never a mock that ratifies a guess.
- A green claim names the independent evaluator + durable evidence (harness run, CI URL, review artifact). Self-report is not verification.

## 🚨 LIVE E2E FIRST — A RECORDING IS NEVER AN ORACLE

**Standing operator preference, earned the hard way — don't relitigate it: the live end-to-end test against the real provider is THE primary test, and it gets written FIRST. Mocks, fixtures and recordings come afterwards, never instead, and never as the thing that grades correctness.**

Refines the section above for the case it doesn't cover: a recording captured from **real** traffic — not a guess, and still not an oracle.

*Reproducible* (same input → same output) is not *determinate* (has a settled truth value). A replay's passing is only conditionally true — conditional on an external fact it no longer checks. The live call is the determinate one: at any instant the provider has exactly one answer and you get it. **Change frequency is irrelevant** — never argue "the world only changes monthly, so replay is the stable layer."

The deciding asymmetry is the *kind* of failure, not the amount: live gives **loud, bounded false-REDs** (host down, rate limit, sandbox reset); replay gives **silent, unbounded false-GREENs** — once the provider changes, every replay stays green and is a lie from then on, precisely where it was meant to warn you. False green is the worse failure mode.

- A recording is a **regression detector on your own code** ("did our parsing change in this refactor?"), never a grader of external semantics.
- **Expiry does not create truth** — a freshness window bounds staleness; an unexpired recording is still only a claim about the past.
- Never downgrade a loud gate with real authority to a quiet one that can be falsely green. Its noise — rate budget, telling *unreachable* apart from *wrong* — is an engineering problem to solve at that gate.

## Raise coverage before mutating

Before any code-changing task on an existing module, its `mix test.json --cover` must be at tier — **≥80%** standard, **≥95%** critical (money, signing, crypto, low-level encoders, security-sensitive parsers; when in doubt, critical). Below tier → write the missing tests first, in this task.

1. `mix test.json --cover --quiet --output /tmp/cov.json`
2. `jq '.coverage.modules[] | select(.module == "MyApp.Foo")' /tmp/cov.json`
3. Below tier → cover the uncovered lines, even ones you didn't come to change. Then mutate.

Exempt: doc-only edits, formatting/alias reordering, pure renames, typo fixes in strings/messages.

## 🚨 NEVER HIDE TEST FAILURES

A test that passes on every outcome is lying. Never `{:error, _} -> assert true`, never a catch-all `{:error, _} -> :ok`, never `IO.puts` + `assert true`.

```elixir
case result do
  {:ok, data} -> assert is_map(data)
  {:error, :insufficient_balance} -> :ok          # this specific error is expected
  {:error, other} -> flunk("Unexpected error: #{inspect(other)}")
end
```

- Don't know what error to expect → don't write the test yet. Explore via Tidewave, then assert.
- Integration tests: never `:skip` on missing credentials. Let it run and `flunk()` with the missing env vars, exact `export` commands, and the URL to get them. "0 failures" from 0 tests is a lie.

## Fix hook-flagged issues on files you touch

Hook fires → fix → re-run → stage. No planning around it, no asking, no discussing whether to. Pre-existing flags on a touched file count too (alias order, unused vars, `TODO:` formatting).

- Scope is only the files your change touched, not the project.
- Generated files → fix the generator.
- Never move the fix to ROADMAP or a follow-up. This commit.
- Don't re-run a check the hook just ran on the same files. Full-suite re-runs earn their cost only before a PR/merge, after `mix deps.get`, after a branch switch, or on request.

## Read to the answer — don't use the runner as an oracle

Reason to the fix by reading code; run once to CONFIRM, not to DISCOVER.

- Read the code path before the test that exercises it.
- Treat a failure as a SURVEY: enumerate every plausible cause from output + one read, fix in a batch, run once.
- Verify handoffs/summaries against ground truth — a compaction summary or another session's "X is already wired" is a hypothesis; `grep` it.
- Flaky terminal → sequential and simple: one command → file → Read. No parallel batches of dependent calls.

## Flaky tests & test-run token economy

- 1–2 failures out of hundreds, in a file your diff didn't touch → flaky **hypothesis**. Re-run that test alone (`mix test.json <file>:<line>` or `--failed`). Passes alone → proceed. One isolated re-run is the whole investigation.
- NEVER `Process.sleep` to fix a flake. Use `assert_receive`/`refute_receive`, `Process.monitor` + `{:DOWN, …}`, `start_supervised!`, or poll-until-condition.
- Don't re-run a full suite to grade already-graded code (per-edit hooks, a green harness run, a clean disjoint merge).
- Bound output: `--cover` dumps hundreds of KB. Always `--output /tmp/cov.json` + `jq`. Triage with `--max-failures 1` / `--failed` / one `file:line`.

## No pseudo-rigorous hedging

You have no consumer telemetry, no usage counts, no demand signal. Don't gate user-requested work behind evidence you cannot obtain. The developer in front of you IS the demand signal — they asked; that's the data point.

STOP if about to write:
- "Demand for X is unproven"
- "We should wait until…"
- "Is this widely needed?"
- "Only worth doing if a Nth+ case is imminent"
- "Bet on usage data before building"

**A legitimate "wait" names an external blocker with an unblock path** — a missing dep, an unreleased upstream, an unactivated market. **"Nobody has asked yet" is not a trigger.** Neither is "it's additive, cheap to add later."

Instead: name actual technical risks ("the macro grows more knobs than the duplication it removes"), cite concrete precedents, or score the task honestly low. Honest framing: *"I don't know if you'll use this 12 more times — that's your call."*

Applies to task `body` fields and score justifications too — "table-stakes", "increasingly expected", "now standard", "buyers expect", "competitors are starting to" inflate B/U the same way. Required: a concrete named reason, or an honest low score.

## Git Commit / Push / PR-Create — Allowed by Default

Commit, push, open PRs without asking when the task calls for it. Announce in one line, then act.

Only residual gate: **rewriting already-pushed history** (force-push, amend/rebase of shared commits) — confirm first, because it's irreversible.

### Stage path-scoped — the working tree is shared

- NEVER `git add -A` / `git add .` / `git commit -a`. Stage explicitly (`git add <path>`) or commit path-scoped (`git commit <path>`).
- Verify before every commit: `git diff --cached --name-only`. A path you didn't touch is someone else's.
- Pre-commit hook trips on a foreign file → path-scoped-stash only their paths (`git stash push -- <paths>`), commit yours, `git stash pop`, re-stage what was staged before. Never format or fix work that isn't yours to clear a hook.
- Untracked files you didn't create: leave them. No `-u` stash, no `add`.

## 🚨 NEVER BROADCAST AN UNPATCHED VULNERABILITY IN A COMMITTED FILE

A committed file is a public file — and permanent in git history. Exploit-actionable detail (attack mechanism, trigger value, PoC, unpublished GHSA/CVE id) never goes into `roadmap/tasks.toml`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, code comments, or commit messages.

- **Open + undisclosed → out of git.** Track in a private draft GitHub Security Advisory (`gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/security-advisories -X POST`, draft; `vulnerabilities[]` needs ecosystem + package + `vulnerable_version_range`). One per issue, full detail there and only there.
- **Fixed AND advisory published → fine to reference.** The gate is both, not either.
- **Need to schedule the work?** File the rmap task with a sanitized body: `"harden Tempo fee-payer gas bounds — see private advisory <id>"`. Never the mechanism.
- **Embargo window:** commit messages and CHANGELOG describe the shape of the fix, not the hole.
- **Inbound reports hide in one place:** privately-reported vulns appear ONLY under Security → Advisories (`gh api repos/<org>/<repo>/security-advisories`) — not Dependabot, not code/secret scanning, not the notifications inbox. Always query it; act on `triage` and `draft`.
- **Public ledgers carry only ✓ closed / 📋 tracked rows** plus a generic open-item count. Never an enumerated map of unpatched weaknesses.
- **On fix:** patch → release → publish the advisory naming the patched version, same day.
- Already committed = already leaked. Redact now and treat git history as compromised (rotate/patch), don't just stop going forward.

## Shell Safety

`rm` is permitted. Before an irreversible delete, glance at the target — no unexpanded `$VAR`, no wildcard catching more than you mean, not a path you didn't create. `git rm` for tracked files keeps the removal in the diff.

## 🚨 NEVER RUN DESTRUCTIVE DEPENDENCY COMMANDS

Never without explicit consent: `mix deps.clean` (incl. `--all`), `mix deps.unlock --all`, `rm -rf _build`, `rm -rf deps`, `mix clean`.

Instead: compile error → retry `mix compile` / `mix test`. Specific dep → `mix deps.compile <dep> --force`. Most "corrupt cache" issues are transient.

## No scope-sequencing qualifiers in durable artifacts

Never write "X first", "starting with X", "initially", "for now", "MVP: X" into repo descriptions, READMEs, moduledocs, code/config comments, commit messages, or vision one-liners. They metastasize and become unremovable. Sequencing lives in the roadmap only (milestones, task bodies, `out_of_scope`). Elsewhere describe what the system IS: "Coverage: Robinhood Chain tokenized equities", not "starting with Robinhood Chain".

## Integrity and accuracy

- Never fabricate information, experience, metrics, timelines, or stats.
- Distinguish codebase observation / general knowledge / best practice / speculation.
- No false authority: no "we learned" without repo evidence, no "after X years in production".
- Uncertain → say so, give ranges over false precision, suggest a validation path.
- Trace sources: "Based on the code in file.ex…", "According to docs/FILE.md…", "Common practice in Elixir…".

## Research before asserting on niche technical claims

Outside reliable training coverage, research proactively — unasked. WebFetch when the canonical URL is known, WebSearch to find one. **Cite what you fetched.**

Research:
- **Wire formats / encodings** — RLP, ABI, SSZ, Protobuf, BLS, BIP-32/39/44, EIP-712, CBOR, ASN.1/DER. Never claim byte order, length-prefix, padding, or canonical form from memory.
- **Protocol details** — EIPs, RFCs, JSON-RPC shapes/error codes, opcode gas, exchange API quirks.
- **Niche / recent library APIs** — about to write `# probably something like`? Fetch the docs.
- **Cross-implementation edge cases** — check ≥2 reference impls; one impl's behavior can be a bug, agreement across two is the spec in practice.

Don't research: pure Elixir/OTP, stdlib, mainstream Phoenix/LiveView/Ecto/Ash, generic REST/HTTP/JSON/SQL/shell, anything in the codebase or an imported CLAUDE.md.

Fetch fails or is ambiguous → say so and lower confidence. Never fall back to "well, I think…" silently.

## No evasion — sit with the hard thing

Hitting a wall → silently moving to easier work is the failure. Stay with it; say "this is hard because X".

Don't use without explicit user approval:
- "let's move on to", "we can defer this", "skip this for now", "let's come back to this later", "let's table this"
- "to keep things simple, I'll skip", "for brevity, I won't", "that's out of scope", "not strictly necessary"
- "that should be enough", "the rest is straightforward", "I'll leave the rest as an exercise"
- "you might want to", "you could manually", "you'll need to handle"

- Blocked → name it: "blocked on X because Y. Options: A, B, C."
- Never a silent workaround. Tempted to add a fallback/nil-guard for missing data → should it come from upstream? Then stop and report.
- Must move on → leave a tracked TODO, not a silent gap.

## Harness Workflow

OTP-native **implement → review → land** loop for roadmap-driven development. An AI orchestrator drives harness; harness dispatches headless implementer agents into isolated git worktrees, then a **cross-family reviewer AI** gates every deliverable (runs the project's checks itself, fixes inline, writes `.harness/review.json`). Optional auto-landing ff-merges approved work; a post-merge audit agent sweeps hygiene.

**Promoted from** `docs/dogfooding-workflow.md` in the harness repo — that file remains the **incubator runbook** for harness-specific history, driver-script templates, and per-batch run logs. This include is the **portfolio-wide contract**. Version-controlled source: `priv/includes/harness-workflow.md` in the harness repo; install to `~/.claude/includes/harness-workflow.md` via `mix harness.install_includes`.

### Relationship to Other Includes (Layered — No Supersession)

| Include | Role relative to harness-workflow |
|---|---|
| `workflow-philosophy.md` | **Foundation.** Evaluator separation, session-per-phase, verification-before-completion. Harness automates the loop while preserving these principles — the **reviewer AI** is the grader, never the implementer's self-report. |
| `task-prioritization.md` | **Task selection.** D/B/U scoring, `rmap next`, parallel markers, refine-don't-duplicate. Harness executes whatever rmap returns; it does not replace prioritization. |
| `worktree-workflow.md` | **Manual parallel sessions.** For hand-build work outside harness dispatch — operator-created worktrees, PR flow, post-merge audit. Harness manages its own per-run worktrees (`harness/<run-id>`); manual worktree rules still apply for hand-build sessions. |
| `dev-lifecycle.md` | **Manual five-phase chain** (`task-driver → worktree → bots → merge → audit-review`). Use when *not* driving through harness. Harness is the automated alternative for dispatchable roadmap tasks; dev-lifecycle still governs plan-and-file, pre-commit review, and post-merge audit. |
| `agent-dispatch.md` / cloud-delegation stack | **Linear/Codex/Cursor PR delegation** without a running harness BEAM. Orthogonal path — projects can use cloud delegation *or* harness; harness subsumes the dispatch+review loop when the OTP node is running. |
| `skills/harness-driver/SKILL.md` (harness repo) | **API surface contract** — MCP tools, `project_eval` patterns, `%LogRecord{}` fields, sharp edges. Load on demand when driving harness; this include covers *workflow*, the skill covers *surfaces*. |

**Adopt per repo:** `@~/.claude/includes/harness-workflow.md` in the project's `CLAUDE.md` (load-on-demand row — not eager; same pattern as `workflow-philosophy.md`).

### The Loop

```
rmap task → implementer AI (worktree) → commit harness/<run-id> → reviewer AI (THE GATE) → done | failed
                                                                              ↓ (done + auto policy)
                                                              MERGE (lander: rebase + ff-push, no re-verify)
                                                                              ↓
                                                              AUDIT (post-merge audit agent, best-effort)
```

One run = one supervised `Harness.Run` gen_statem: fork worktree off target `HEAD`, dispatch implementer, commit diff to `harness/<run-id>`, dispatch cross-family reviewer into the same worktree. The reviewer runs the project's `check_command` hint, fixes what it can, writes `.harness/review.json`. **Success = reviewer `approve`** — never implementer exit code or self-report. There is **no mechanical verification gate** in harness; judgment lives in agents.

Rejections put the task back in the queue for re-dispatch. Fix-and-approve is the near-absolute default for the reviewer.

**🚨 "Cross-family" is routing doctrine, not a mechanical guarantee.** Harness excludes only the *identical* agent from the reviewer slate (`Harness.Agents.reviewers/1` → `reject_implementer/2`); there is **no family concept in harness code**, so a `cursor` implementer can draw a `grok` reviewer even though both run SpaceXAI weights. The orchestrator owns the separation when it matters. This is deliberate, not an oversight: measured 2026-08-23 over 1,627 harness reviews, controlling for reviewer identity leaves no per-pair signal — review intervention is a **per-reviewer** trait (median `reviewer_diff_size`: Codex 96, Cursor 4, Claude 1, Grok 0), and the most capable reviewer in the ledger finds median 0 in the same work a heavier reviewer rewrites. Don't add a family scheduler to make the code match the older wording.

### When to Dispatch vs Hand-Build

**An rmap task is not automatically a harness run.** Dispatch only when the full
implement→review→land cycle buys meaningful safety, independent verification, or
parallel throughput. Historical run cost stays material even for D≤2 work, so the
old D≤2 / 30-LOC conjunctive exception was too narrow.

**Work inline by default when it is bounded and local:** one coherent surface,
typically D≤4, roughly ≤100 LOC across ≤5 files, focused-testable, and no positive
dispatch trigger below. These are routing hints, not an ALL-of gate — a risky D2
task can earn dispatch, while a routine D4 task can stay inline.

Positive dispatch triggers:

- Signing, money handling, cryptography, security, or authorization
- A public API/schema/contract change or a migration
- Harness runtime, CI/check infrastructure, or a repo-wide invariant
- Live/external-system semantics that need independent evidence
- Multiple subsystems, or genuinely useful parallel execution

Hand-build when harness cannot perform or judge the work:

- Scaffolding that reshapes harness runtime (supervision tree, dep stack, Endpoint) **while the run lifecycle itself is in flux**
- Work requiring live human/browser judgment, such as exploratory visual identity; routine spec-anchored UI remains dispatchable
- A harness gap — file via `rmap new`, fix harness, re-dispatch; do not work around the gap inside the target task

**🚨 The routing gate fires at `assignee =`, not at dispatch time.** rmap requires `assignee` + `model` at task creation, so the inline-vs-dispatch decision is made — and frozen — the moment the task is filed: a task carrying an agent assignee reads as "routing already decided" to every later session, and this section never gets consulted again. Three rules close that hole:

- **Filing a task: run this section BEFORE typing `assignee` — and a FILED task defaults to an agent.** The inline-vs-dispatch question above governs work you can execute *now*: inline-doable work is done inline and never filed. A task that reaches filing is cross-session by definition, so default-route it to a dispatch agent with a pinned `model` (roster spread per § "Roster doctrine"); `assignee = "human"` must be earned by a hand-build reason named in the body — an operator-gated step (license, credential, purchase), no-spec visual identity, harness-loop-in-flux, or the user claiming the work. (A D2 one-file fix is done inline, never filed — filing it is the defect.) Mirrored as question 6 of `task-writing.md`'s Pre-Creation Gate.
- **Reviewer `proposed_tasks` carry no routing authority.** Proposals arrive dispatch-shaped (suggested scores/markers), but the orchestrator owns routing the same way it owns filing — re-route each proposal through this gate instead of inheriting dispatchability from its shape. Sibling of task-writing's "Re-Generalize an Agent's Decomposition": that filters whose *architecture* a task encodes; this filters whose *routing* it encodes.
- **🚨 Under `dispatch_mode: "auto"` there is no such thing as an open decision in a task body — decide it at filing or don't file the task `pending`.** `task-writing.md`'s gate 6 permits a `pending` task to carry named open decisions because "the orchestrator asks before it dispatches." That sentence assumes a human-driven orchestrator seat between the queue and the run. **A cron poller is not that seat**: in `:auto` mode it dispatches the ready set unattended on its schedule, reads no bodies, and asks no one — so the decision reaches an implementer as a question addressed to nobody, and the implementer answers it silently. Before filing into an auto-dispatching project, check `autonomy-status` (per-project `dispatch_mode` + `effective`) and `project_registry-lookup`, then:
  - **Decide it yourself and write the decision in, vetoable.** Name the choice, the reasoning, and the alternatives you rejected. `critical-rules.md` § SURFACE THE OVERRIDE is satisfied by a decision the operator can read and reverse; it does not require a blocking question.
  - **When one premise could genuinely flip the answer, ship the decision with an evidence gate** — "ship (a) unless a live probe disproves X, in which case (b); say in the delivery which you found." That is a decision the implementer can execute, not a question it must route back.
  - **`blocked` is still not the escape hatch.** It hides the task from the queue, so the decision is never surfaced at all — the same failure with a quieter shape. Reserve it for an external blocker with an unblock path.
  - Under `:manual` cron mode the parked-decision drain (`dispatch-pending` / `dispatch-approve`) *does* restore the asking seat, and gate 6 reads as written. Know which mode the project is in before relying on it.

### Running a Task

**Prerequisites:** long-lived harness BEAM (`iex -S mix` in the harness checkout), target project registered in `Harness.ProjectRegistry`, clean `git status` on the target's dispatch branch (runs fork worktrees off `HEAD`). **Roadmap ingest and writeback self-sync when they can.** The run's *code* base is fresh (Task 196: with a `target_branch` set, `Run.Actions.Worktree.worktree_opts/1` fetches and forks off `origin/<target>`). `dispatch-task` / `dispatch-bundle` now also fetch the roadmap branch and fast-forward the `project.roadmap_path` checkout (`Harness.Git.TargetSync.sync_checkout/2`, ff-only, never `--force`) before `rmap` runs, and the writeback path does the same before the `roadmap: task <id> -> in_progress` commit, so a task you filed and pushed from another host is visible without a manual pull. The residual operator action is a **dirty, non-ff-diverged, detached, or self-host** checkout — those skip with a witnessed log and ingest proceeds on the on-disk file; sync them by hand (`git -C <roadmap_path> pull --ff-only`) before dispatching.

**Three dispatch paths** (prefer top to bottom):

1. **Native MCP — default.** `dispatch-task` (fire-and-forget) against `http://localhost:4018/harness/mcp`; wait for the wave by watching `origin/<target>` for the lander's commits, never by blocking on `dispatch-await` / `dispatch-await_runs` (§ "Never block on `dispatch-await*`"). Observe via `dispatch-status`, `dispatch-transcript`, `dispatch-verdict_detail`. `scrub_anthropic_key: true` (default) forces subscription OAuth over inherited `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
2. **Tidewave `project_eval` — escape hatch.** Struct-level control the flat tools don't expose (`retry_policy`, fail-over adapter lists, `subscriber: self()`). Run persists to `Harness.ResultStore` even when the eval process exits.
3. **`mix run` driver script — fallback.** Full transcript + reviewer report to terminal. See harness repo `docs/dogfooding-workflow.md` for the canonical template.

> **Never start a second driver BEAM while runs are in flight.** Boot-time worktree sweeps can prune live sibling worktrees. Drive all parallel batches from one long-lived node.

**In-flight idempotency (Task 286):** a second `dispatch-task` / `dispatch-bundle` of the same `{project, task_id}` while a non-terminal run exists returns the **existing** `run_id` (Oban `conflict?: true`), not a duplicate — a retried dispatch is safe and free.

**Coalesce small related tasks:** `dispatch-coalesce` accepts an explicit task-id list and runs it as one worktree, implementer invocation, reviewer gate, and landing unit. Use it when small tasks share a bundle/surface and separating them would only repeat fixed run costs; keep independent tasks in `dispatch-bundle` so write-disjoint work still parallelizes. Coalesced members share the same landing SHA and never partially land — the reviewer must mark every member `approved` in the verdict's `task_outcomes` or the run fails as a unit. The call returns the coalesced `write_set` (the union of every member's `touches`/`files_to_modify`); serialize the next wave against that union, since harness executes the coalesce but never picks what to coalesce.

**Write-set serialization (Task 292):** `dispatch-bundle` and cron ready-set dispatch compute each task's `touches ∪ files_to_modify` before enqueue. Tasks with overlapping write-sets are logged and serialized into later waves instead of fanned out together. Callers no longer hand-dedupe ready sets; they must keep `touches` / `files_to_modify` accurate because harness does not infer paths from task prose.

**Renderable vs executable:** `rmap delegate --to` renders native prompts for all six harness adapters (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `grok`, `antigravity`, `pi`). `droid` renders but has no harness adapter — rejected at ingest. All six shipped adapters declare `worktree_isolation: true`.

### Routing & Model Management

- **Resolve `assignee` + `model` from facts, not by reading code.** `routing-brief` is the thin task-writer index: dispatchable agent roster, each agent's standing model (`Config.agent_model/1`), model availability/blocks, and per-agent KPI rollups — every metric carries `n`, no ranking. A model-capable agent with no configured model shows `model: nil, model_required: true`.
- **Scout routing (advisory).** `dispatch-recommend` returns the cross-family scout AI's per-facet `:exploit` pick (with rationale) or a safe `:explore` / `:fallback_no_data` when a facet is unmeasured; `dispatch-assess_facets` forces a fresh scout assessment. The caller decides whether to dispatch the pick — legacy composite scores are not used for routing.
- **Model is required, never defaulted.** Implementer precedence: **task `model` → `{:agent_model, agent}` → REJECT** (`{:model_required, agent}`) — harness never falls through to the CLI's ambient default. The **reviewer has no task-pin axis**: its model comes solely from `{:agent_model, agent}` for the reviewer adapter's agent (`Run.reviewer_model/1`), and a model-capable reviewer with no configured model is rejected *before* the reviewer spawns. Antigravity is model-capable as of `agy` 1.0.10 (`--model` + `agy models`); harness validates pins against its catalog because the CLI silently falls back on unknown ids.
- **Block exhausted premium models.** A monthly budget can exhaust (e.g. cursor-Opus) while harness still lists the pair as available and routes to it. `model_availability-block_model` (with a `blocked_until` window) removes the pair from routing/cron; `model_availability-unblock_model` clears it.
- **Cost-aware A/B.** `dispatch-compare` runs one task across N adapters (optional per-adapter model overrides) and returns per-adapter `verdict` / `reviewer_diff_size` / `duration_ms` / `token_usage` for selection.

### Reading the Verdict

| `state` / `reason` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `:done` / `:approved` | Reviewer AI approved (possibly after inline fixes — check `reviewer_diff_size`). | Deliverable on `harness/<run-id>`. Review diff, integrate (or let auto-lander handle it), `rmap status <id> done`. |
| `:failed` / `{:review_rejected, report}` | Reviewer rejected (degenerate — near-never by design). | Read `report`. Task back in queue; re-dispatch. |
| `:failed` / `{:review_stuck, report}` | No verdict: reviewer unavailable, crashed, or missing/malformed `.harness/review.json`. | Read `report`. Fix environment or re-dispatch. |
| `:failed` / `{:worktree_failed,_}` `{:agent_spawn_failed,_}` `{:driver_crashed,_}` `{:commit_failed,_}` | Harness-side mechanical failure. | **Harness bug.** File via `rmap new`. |
| `:failed` / `{:checkout_polluted, status}` | Agent wrote outside the run worktree into the main checkout — surfaces as `:failed` **only after bounded AI recovery was exhausted** (see "Self-healing recovery" below). | Recovery declared the run dead. Likely an agent/adapter isolation issue; re-dispatch with a worktree-honoring adapter. |
| `:failed` / `{:checkout_pollution_check_failed, _}` | Post-run pollution `git status` errored. | Rare; transient git/IO. Re-run; inspect checkout if persistent. |
| `:failed` / `:timed_out` | Lifetime budget elapsed. | Raise `:lifetime_timeout` or investigate hang. |
| run process **crashed** (no settle) | gen_statem died. | **Harness bug.** File via `rmap new`. |

Failed runs retain the worktree at `result.worktree_path` for inspection. Approved runs keep branch `harness/<run-id>` after worktree teardown. Use `dispatch-verdict_detail` for the reviewer report, ratings, checks, concerns, proposed tasks, warning flag, and `reviewer_diff_size` — no harness-run mechanical per-check stdout.

**The verdict artifact** `.harness/review.json` is `{verdict, run_id, review_attempt, report, checks, concerns, proposed_tasks, facets, skills, ratings}`: `verdict` (`approve`/`reject`) is the gate; `run_id` and `review_attempt` fence the file to the reviewer invocation that wrote it (echoed from `HARNESS_RUN_ID` / `HARNESS_REVIEW_ATTEMPT`; a mismatch is treated as missing); `report` is the reviewer's prose; `checks` is the reviewer-written record of commands run and their pass/fail claim; `concerns` is the reviewer's self-flagged caveat list; `proposed_tasks` is an optional list of structured discovery proposals (`title`, `body`, suggested scores/markers, and evidence); **`facets`** (open-vocabulary routing KEY — the kind of task) and **`skills`** (v0_13 two-axis rubric, routing VALUE) feed per-facet capability routing; `ratings` is the legacy flat-score fallback. Harness persists proposals verbatim but never files them. After a run lands, the orchestrator reads them from `dispatch-verdict_detail`, dedupes/merges them against the live pending set, and files only warranted tasks through its own task-writing gate. Reviewers never edit `roadmap/tasks.toml`, `roadmap/data.json`, `ROADMAP.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md`; those files are excluded from delivery commits alongside `.harness/`. Approved runs with non-empty concerns or a reviewer-authored failed check surface a warning fact; harness never auto-blocks or classifies prose. The artifact lives under `.harness/` (excluded from staging) so it never rides in the deliverable commit. The file is removed before every reviewer spawn so a killed reviewer's stale approve cannot settle the run.

**External-system evidence is reviewer-owned judgment.** When acceptance criteria touch an API or external service, the reviewer must look for reality rather than plausibility: a live success call, a relevant live error, the provider's official docs/spec/SDK for semantic meaning, and an integration test pinning the observed domain semantics. Third-party clients, aggregators, wrappers, and reference implementations (including CCXT) are compatibility/reference evidence only; they never establish correctness or override the provider-owned contract. Mocks, fixtures, and the implementer's self-report are not independent evidence. Missing credentials or an unreachable sandbox are surfaced as a failed check/concern (or rejection when the criterion cannot be verified), never silently treated as green. The lander records the reviewer identity plus `harness-run:<run-id>` as rmap verification provenance.

**Self-healing recovery (the `:recovering` state).** Before settling `:failed` for an *interpretive* non-rejection failure — checkout pollution is currently the one wired call-site — the run spawns a **bounded cross-family recovery AI** (`:recovering` state, budget 1/run) with minimal context (the error term + the main checkout's `git status` + the implementer transcript tail + the failing-check output, never the full transcript). It writes `.harness/recovery.json` `{outcome: "repaired"|"dead", report, repaired}`; harness reads it mechanically and **decides nothing itself**: `repaired` resumes at `:committing` and **re-runs the reviewer gate** (never skips to `:done`); `dead` / missing / malformed settles `:failed` with the original reason. A genuine `verdict: reject` is never routed through recovery. The `Result` carries `recovery_attempts` / `recovery_outcome` / `recovery_repaired` / `recovery_token_usage`. (Tier-1 mechanical self-heal precedes it: the reviewer is re-prompted once on a missing/malformed `review.json` — `reviewer_reprompt_count`, capped at 1 — and rotates to the next cross-family candidate on a reviewer timeout — `reviewer_rotation_count`.)

### 🚨 Recover, Don't Redo — Never Burn Tokens Re-Implementing Committed Work

**A run that committed to `harness/<run-id>` already paid for the implementer. Recovering that branch costs a fraction of a fresh dispatch — re-dispatching from `pending` throws the work away and makes the agent redo all of it.** The reflex to "reset → pending → dispatch again" is a token bonfire whenever a retained branch with commits exists. Check for the branch *first*; pick the cheapest primitive that fits:

| Run state — committed `harness/<run-id>` branch exists | Recover with | Agent tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Approved but unlanded (land-cap, lander crash) | `dispatch-reland` | **zero** — pure git rebase + push |
| Committed, review-stage failure (work is good) | `dispatch-rereview` | zero implementer — re-enters at the reviewer gate |
| Committed, implement-stage incomplete/`:failed` | `dispatch-resume_failed` (`escalate: true` to re-route agent) | **re-spends implementer tokens** — a fresh implementer invocation branched off the retained commits with the failure report injected (contrast `rereview`, which re-runs only the reviewer) |
| Live `:held` run (paused, not dead) | `dispatch-resume` | none — un-pauses in place |
| **No commits / no retained branch** | reset → `pending` + fresh `dispatch-task` | full redo — **the only case where this is correct** |

**Live-run intervention (not recovery of a dead run):** `dispatch-hold` (optionally `interrupt: true`) parks a live run mid-turn, `dispatch-steer` stashes guidance applied on resume, `dispatch-resume` un-pauses in place, `dispatch-cancel` kills it (idempotent). Use hold → steer → resume to force-hand a grinding implementer to the reviewer gate instead of burning the lifetime budget.

**The gate before any reset-to-pending + re-dispatch:** `git branch -a | grep harness/<run-id>` and `git log --oneline origin/<target>..harness/<run-id>`. Commits present ⇒ recover, never redo.

**🚨 First, confirm the run actually *didn't* land — check `origin`, not your local checkout.** Under `landing_policy: :auto` the lander pushes to `origin/<target>` from a detached worktree, then `Harness.Git.TargetSync` may fast-forward the operator's local target when that is safe (off-target → ff the branch ref; on-target + clean tree → `merge --ff-only`). It skips — witnessed, never `--force` — when the tree is dirty, the update is not a fast-forward, or the target is this running node's own source tree (self-host: path identity, not the project name). Under dogfooding that self-host skip is the common case, so after an autonomous land your local `tasks.toml` is **stale**: it still reads `in_progress` for a task the lander already marked `done --shipped-in` on origin. **Reading that stale local status as "the run didn't land" is the trap** — it triggers a wasteful reset-to-`pending` + re-dispatch that *duplicate-lands already-shipped work*. Before concluding anything from task status, `git fetch origin <target> && git rebase origin/<target>` (the existing "Sync main before committing" rule) or read ground truth directly:
- `git log --oneline origin/<target>` — does it already show `task <id> -> done (shipped …)` and the agent-delivery commit? Then it **landed**; your local view was just behind. Do nothing but rebase.
- `dispatch-status <run-id>` / `result_store-list_run_records run_id:<id>` — a record with `state: done, verdict: approve` means the run succeeded; cross-check landing against origin before touching the roadmap.

The recovery primitives (`reland`/`rereview`/`resume_failed`) read the persisted `ResultStore` record, which **survives** worktree teardown and node restarts — so a genuinely approved-but-unlanded run (lander hit its land-cap, or a real rebase conflict retained the branch) is recoverable token-free via `dispatch-reland`. Reserve reset-to-`pending` for runs with **no committed branch and no settled record** — and only after confirming against `origin` that the work isn't already shipped.

### Parallel Dispatch

`Harness.Run.Supervisor` is a `DynamicSupervisor` — N crash-isolated runs, each with its own worktree.

- **Batch by dependency graph, then write-set.** Every pending task whose `depends_on` is satisfied can enter the ready set, but harness dispatches only the first wave whose `touches ∪ files_to_modify` are disjoint. Overlapping tasks wait for a later wave after the landed base moves forward.
- **Keep write-set fields accurate.** The dispatcher counts declared path intersections; it does not infer paths from the task body. If two tasks really edit the same function, either let write-set serialization sequence them or fold the coupled work into one rmap task (`task-prioritization.md` § "Refine, Don't Duplicate").
- **One driver BEAM** for all concurrent runs in a wave.
- **Integration order (manual landing):** smallest/isolated diffs onto target first; rebase siblings; run the project's check command on target after last merge.
- **While a wave is in flight:** do not run `rmap status` / `rmap mark` / `rmap new` in parallel sessions against the same checkout — triggers `:checkout_polluted` false-positive.
- **Repo-wide invariant tasks run EXCLUSIVE.** A task whose real write-set is "the whole surface" — introduce a repo-wide guard/invariant and convert every violating site (e.g. an AST-scan test over all of `test/`) — cannot be write-set-serialized by declared `touches`: any sibling land that adds a new violating site after the fork reddens the guard at landing time. Dispatch such tasks as a solo wave — nothing lands in parallel — or accept that the orchestrator repairs at landing.
- **Land-conflict repair is a standard orchestrator move, not an incident.** When the lander blocks on a rebase conflict (reason retains the branch): fork a repair worktree off `origin/<target>`, cherry-pick the run commits, resolve (for additive `tasks.toml` collisions: renumber the branch-side new task to the next free id on origin **and rewrite in-diff string references to it** — CHANGELOG lines, code comments; then `rmap validate && rmap render`), point the retained `harness/<run-id>` branch at the repaired tip, and `dispatch-reland` — the lander keeps push authority and advances rmap itself. **Do not re-run gates on a roadmap/doc-only repair:** the reviewer already graded the code; renumbering tasks, merging doc entries, and re-rendering the roadmap change nothing the gates measure, and a clean disjoint auto-merge of verified code needs no re-grade (same token-economy rule as everywhere else). Re-run a check ONLY when the repair touched code, or when the conflict overlapped a repo-wide invariant the sibling lands could have violated (e.g. a new suite-wide guard vs tests added after the fork — run just that guard, not the stack). Never reset-to-pending (that redoes paid work), never hand-push to the target when a reland can land it.

### Autonomous Landing

Projects with `landing_policy: :auto` or `:pr` and a non-empty `target_branch`:

1. Approved run enqueues one job on serialized `landing_<name>` Oban queue (limit 1)
2. `Harness.Lander.land/1` rebases `harness/<run-id>` onto `origin/<target>` in a detached worktree
3. **`:auto`** — **ff-pushes without re-verification** — the reviewer already gated the work.
   **`:pr`** — force-with-lease-pushes the rebased tip to `origin/harness/<run-id>` (never the
   target) and opens a GitHub pull request with `gh` (`gh pr create --base <target> --head harness/<run-id>`).
   `Git.TargetSync` is not run. A missing or unauthenticated `gh` fails the landing job with a
   witnessed reason, retains the branch, and never falls back to a direct push.
4. **`:auto`** — successful push enqueues post-merge audit; advances rmap (`done --verified --verified-by <reviewer> --verification-ref harness-run:<run-id> --shipped-in <sha>`).
   **`:pr`** — writeback is deferred: the rmap task stays `in_progress` (`rmap status <id> in_progress --landing-ref <url>` when rmap supports the flag; an older binary is logged and tolerated), the run record stores `pr_url`, and a `:pr_opened` witness fires. `Harness.Lander.PRPoller` (Oban cron, default every 5 minutes) reads `gh pr view --json state,mergeCommit,mergedAt`. MERGED performs the same three effects `:auto` does at push time (rmap `done --shipped-in <merge sha>` + post-merge audit + `:landed`). CLOSED-unmerged marks the task `blocked` with `PR <url> closed unmerged` in the reason and retains the branch — never reset to pending, never re-dispatched. OPEN is a no-op. A run is written back at most once.

Conflict / push-rejected retains the branch for repair — never lands red. Witness notification (read-only sink) alerts the operator; it is **not** a merge gate.

**🚨 Never block on `dispatch-await*` — monitor `origin` for the landing commit instead.**
This is the standing rule for waiting on a wave, not a fallback. `dispatch-await` /
`dispatch-await_runs` hold an MCP request open for the entire run, and an MCP client
kills a tool call that emits no progress for its idle timeout (Claude Code's default is
300s — far shorter than any real run). The call dies, the orchestrator learns nothing,
and the runs keep going regardless. Worse, awaiting the wrong signal: **await returns at
reviewer settle, which fires BEFORE the serialized `landing_<name>` job rebases and
ff-pushes** — so even a successful `approve` means "approved and *queued* to land," never
"on `origin/<target>`." Under `landing_policy: :pr` the same gap is longer: MERGE opens a
PR instead of pushing the target, and rmap `done --shipped-in` waits for that PR to merge.

**The primitive that actually works — watch the target branch for the lander's own
commits.** The lander pushes `task <id> -> done (shipped <sha>)` to `origin/<target>`;
that commit IS the landed signal, it is durable, and it survives a dead MCP call, a
restarted session, and a node bounce. Arm one background watcher per wave and keep
working:

```bash
# one notification per landed task, exits when the whole wave is in
cd <source-checkout>
WAVE="615 623 569 619"; seen=""; BASE=$(git rev-parse origin/<target>)
DEADLINE=$(($(date +%s) + 10800))  # bound the wait; tune to the wave's slowest run
while true; do
  git fetch -q origin <target> || true
  for t in $WAVE; do
    case " $seen " in *" $t "*) continue;; esac
    if git log --oneline "$BASE"..origin/<target> | grep -q "task $t -> done"; then
      echo "LANDED task $t"; seen="$seen $t"
    fi
  done
  [ "$(echo $seen | wc -w)" -eq "$(echo $WAVE | wc -w)" ] && { echo "WAVE COMPLETE"; break; }
  [ "$(date +%s)" -gt "$DEADLINE" ] && {
    echo "DEADLINE EXCEEDED — wave incomplete"
    git log --oneline "$BASE"..origin/<target> | grep "task.*-> done" | sed 's/.*task \([0-9]*\).*/  landed: \1/' || echo "  (no tasks landed in range)"
    for t in $WAVE; do
      case " $seen " in *" $t "*) continue;; esac
      echo "  missing: $t"
    done
    break
  }
  sleep 60
done
```

🚨 **The baseline is load-bearing — grep the range, never the whole log.** A task that
landed before, or was reset and re-dispatched, already carries `roadmap: task <id> -> done
(shipped …)` in history; without `BASE` the watcher reports `LANDED` before the implementer
has written a line.

The deadline branch is the other half. A run that fails review or blocks on a land conflict never
produces a landing commit, so a watcher with no bound waits forever on a wave that is already
dead; on expiry it must print what did land in the range and name what did not, so the missing
tasks get reconciled through `dispatch-status` instead of assumed.

Poll `dispatch-status <run-id>` only to diagnose a run that the watcher shows as *not*
landing — a `:failed` verdict, a rebase conflict that retained the branch, a hung
implementer. Status is for diagnosis; git is for waiting.

**Silence is not success** — a run that fails review or blocks on a land conflict never
produces a landing commit, so a watcher greping only for `-> done` stays quiet forever.
Bound every wave watch with a deadline, and when it expires without `WAVE COMPLETE`,
reconcile the missing tasks through `dispatch-status` / `result_store-list_run_records`
before assuming anything.

Same root cause as the duplicate-land trap above, seen from the dispatch side: **origin is
the source of truth for what landed** — not an await return value, not a local
`tasks.toml`, not a transcript.

**Herdr panes are an optional operator convenience for watching, never a harness
surface.** When the orchestrator session runs inside Herdr (`HERDR_ENV=1` — the
operator's default), the wave watcher above and ad-hoc run babysitting can run
*visibly*: `herdr pane split --current --no-focus` + `pane run` for the watcher
loop, an attach pane tailing `dispatch-transcript` for a run under scrutiny,
`herdr worktree open --path <retained-worktree>` to inspect a failed run, and
`herdr notification show "…" --sound done` as a configured witness-notification
sink. Strictly operator-side: dispatched agents stay headless over Ports, and
Herdr's `idle`/`blocked` classification is never a harness signal (adjudicated —
harness repo `docs/orchestration-library-evaluation.md`, Addendum 2026-08-25,
incl. the deliberately unmitigated `HERDR_*` env-inheritance risk for dispatched
agents).

**Cron manual-approval mode.** A per-project cron poller in `:auto` mode dispatches unattended; in `:manual` mode it **parks** each dispatch decision instead of enqueuing — drain the parked decisions with `dispatch-pending` and approve them with `dispatch-approve`, keeping the orchestrator in the loop for autonomous polling.

### Orchestrator Loop — the Architect Seat the Per-Task Reviewer Can't Fill

The sections above document the *mechanisms*; this is the **continuous loop** the driving AI runs across waves:

```
plan wave → dispatch → watch origin for the landing commits → run integration suite on the landed base
          ↑                                                     + review whole surface vs roadmap intent & domain invariants
          └── reconcile rmap ← encode any whole-surface finding as a criterion/test ←┘
```

Each arrow reuses an existing mechanism — don't restate them here: *watch origin for the landing commits* (§ "Never block on `dispatch-await*`", and § "Recover, Don't Redo" → the duplicate-land trap), *reconcile rmap* (the lander already advanced `done --shipped-in` under auto-land — verify, don't double-write), *next wave* (§ "Parallel Dispatch" + write-set serialization).

**🚨 Three review seats, each blind where the next sees — the orchestrator seat is mandatory, not optional.** The per-task reviewer gates *one diff against one task* and is **structurally blind** to two defect classes that land clean through it (worked evidence: delta_calc tasks 24/25/26, see its `## Review Blind Spots` / `## Domain Invariants`):

| Seat | What it sees | What it CANNOT see |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-task reviewer** (cross-family, the gate) | one diff vs one task's acceptance criteria + mechanical checks, in an isolated worktree off a base | the whole surface; domain ground truth |
| **Post-merge audit AI** (best-effort) | cold build of the merged commit range; hygiene | whether a domain constant is *wrong*; roadmap-intent fit |
| **Orchestrator** (the architect seat — you) | whole integrated surface vs roadmap intent + domain invariants across all landed waves | — (this is the seat of last resort) |

The two blind classes, both real-correctness, both passing every per-task check:

- **Domain ground truth** — a wrong venue constant (`@funding_periods_per_day 3`, overstating Deribit's hourly funding ~8×) is internally consistent and fully tested *because the golden was computed with the same wrong constant* — coverage ratifies the bug. The reviewer has no signal; that knowledge lives in the architect's head.
- **Cross-module global invariants** — write-set-disjoint parallel dispatch means two worktrees can each define `project_payback_timeline` and neither review sees the other; the collision only exists once both have landed on the integrated base. Only a whole-surface seat catches it.

**🚨 Run the integration suite on the landed base — this is NOT redundant with per-task review.** After each wave lands, run the project's full check (`mix ci` / `mix precommit.full`) on the freshly-landed `origin/<target>`. The per-task reviewer ran the dispatch-scale check hint (for Elixir, `mix check.dispatch` plus focused `mix test.json ...` for touched behavior) in an *isolated worktree off an earlier base, before sibling waves landed* — cross-module breakage doesn't exist until multiple landed diffs coexist. This generalizes the manual-landing-only "run the project's check command on target after last merge" (§ "Parallel Dispatch") into a standing per-wave step.

**Capture dispatch-check output once, to a unique tmp log.** Dispatch checks are normally verbose. The reviewer should capture the first run instead of re-running for readability: `LOG=$(mktemp -t harness-check-dispatch.XXXXXX.log)` then `mix check.dispatch > "$LOG" 2>&1`; inspect with `tail -200 "$LOG"` / `rg "error|failed|warning" "$LOG"` and record the log path in `.harness/review.json`. The random `mktemp` path prevents parallel agents from clobbering each other's logs.

**🚨 Architect/QA is a workflow responsibility, not a harness runtime gate.** After a wave lands, the orchestrator must run the full landed-base gate, review the integrated surface against roadmap intent/domain invariants, fix findings, and only then dispatch the next wave. Harness does not pause dispatches or store a completion marker for this step; this is the driving AI's seat.

**Two framing guards — keep this consistent with the harness mantra:**

- **It's an agent seat, not harness code.** The mantra ("count facts in code; judge with an AI") forbids *harness* computing meaning — it does **not** forbid the orchestrator AI from reviewing the whole surface or running the suite. This adds no mechanical gate to harness; it's judgment in an agent, which is exactly where judgment belongs.
- **The output crystallizes into encoded invariants — don't leave it a manual sweep.** When the architect seat catches a whole-surface or domain defect, the highest-value move is not the manual catch — it's pushing the rule into an **acceptance criterion or a manifest-wide CI test** (the delta_calc rule) so the per-task gate absorbs that class going forward. Orchestrator review *feeds* the criteria/CI; it must not become a permanent re-review of every diff. A finding caught twice by hand is a missing test.

**Convergence sweep (append-only).** The architect seat's whole-surface pass has a disciplined output shape (inspired by spec-kit's `/speckit.converge`, github/spec-kit): assess the landed code against the **roadmap + acceptance criteria as the sole source of intent** — never against the orchestrator's memory of what it dispatched or what a transcript claimed. Three rules:

- **Sole source of intent.** The gap being measured is code vs. `tasks.toml` ACs and roadmap/milestone intent. If the intent itself was wrong, that's a task edit first, then a sweep against the corrected intent.
- **Append, never rewrite.** Every unmet criterion, partial delivery, or intent gap becomes a **new `rmap new` task** (D/B/U-scored, gated per `task-writing.md`) referencing the task it converges on. Never reopen, rewrite, renumber, or edit the history of existing tasks to make the gap disappear — `attempts`/`implemented` records are evidence, not scratch space.
- **Clean sweep = zero mutations.** When the surface already satisfies the roadmap, the sweep leaves `tasks.toml` **byte-for-byte unchanged** — no empty "convergence" ceremony entries, no touched timestamps. A sweep that always writes something is measuring itself, not the code.

### Portfolio Conventions

- **Agent does not commit unless asked.** Staged-but-uncommitted is the default handoff between implementer and reviewer sessions (`workflow-philosophy.md` § "Implementer / Reviewer Handoff"). Harness runs commit agent work to `harness/<run-id>` automatically — that is harness's deliverable branch, not the operator's main checkout.
- **Reviewer discoveries arrive as proposals, and the ORCHESTRATOR files them post-land.** A reviewer that filed a discovery by editing `roadmap/tasks.toml` in its worktree assigned ids from a stale fork (id collisions that block the lander — observed ccxt_client 2026-07-19), couldn't see the live pending set (so the one-session=one-task merge gate never fired), and made roadmap files a universal write-set overlap across "disjoint" waves. That channel is closed: reviewers now emit `proposed_tasks` in `.harness/review.json`, and `roadmap/tasks.toml`, `roadmap/data.json`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` are excluded from delivery commits, so a run diff carries only code. After each land, read the proposals via `dispatch-verdict_detail` and file only the warranted ones through your own task-writing gate — dedupe against the live pending set, merge per `task-writing.md`, score with real ids off `origin`. Harness persists proposals verbatim and never files them.
  - **🚨 Default-DECLINE — the proposal pipeline outproduces the backlog's right to grow.** Reviewer + audit agents emit ~1 proposal per run; an orchestrator that files "everything evidenced and cross-session" lands N tasks and files N new ones per wave — net backlog delta ±0, the roadmap never converges. Evidence + cross-session is the FLOOR, not the bar. File a proposal only when ALL THREE hold: (a) real defect or invariant gap with evidence, (b) not foldable into an existing pending task — and when the proposal patches an instance of a class, scope the filing as the CLASS invariant so the next instance can't spawn a sibling task, (c) not inline-doable in minutes by the orchestrator — if it is, DO it now instead of filing. Declined proposals need no ceremony: the verdict record in the ResultStore is their evidence trail.
  - **Report the net backlog delta** (landed − filed) as an explicit number in every wave/session wrap-up. A session trending ±0 or negative-growth is the churn alarm firing — tighten the decline bar, don't normalize it.
- **Witness notification is sakshi (read-only).** Landing outcomes notify via configured command sink; the sink grants no merge capability. Human operator reviews blocked/conflict outcomes — harness does not silently force-push past conflicts.
- **`check_command` is a dispatch-scale hint to the reviewer.** Free text (e.g. `"mix check.dispatch"` for Elixir, with focused tests chosen by the reviewer) — the reviewer runs and judges it; harness does not execute it mechanically. Keep full-suite commands like `mix precommit.full` for the landed-base Architect/QA pass. For verbose checks, capture to a per-run `mktemp` log on the first execution; never re-run only to recover truncated output.
- **The cross-family reviewer reads `AGENTS.md`, not your Claude skills/includes.** `AGENTS.md` is generated from `CLAUDE.md` by `claude-marketplace/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh`, which recursively inlines every `@`-import. **Regenerate it after any `CLAUDE.md` change** (`bash ~/_DATA/code/claude-marketplace/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh`, or `--dry-run` to preview) so the reviewer gates against current rules — a stale `AGENTS.md` makes codex/cursor/grok judge against rules you've already changed. **`--check` is the freshness gate** — it re-renders in memory and exits non-zero if `AGENTS.md` has drifted (diffs rendered output, not mtimes, so it catches drift in transitive `@`-imports too); wire it into CI / a pre-commit hook / the `check_command` so staleness fails loudly instead of silently. Consequence under Opus-4.8 skill-on-demand: once `CLAUDE.md` slims to the eager floor, reviewer-critical facts that *were* carried by eager includes (the `check_command` gate; that `mix test.json` / `mix dialyzer.json` emit JSON **by design** — parse for real failures, never flag the envelope; plain `mix dialyzer` is authoritative when the JSON encoder can't serialize a warning) no longer reach `AGENTS.md` via those imports. Put them in a **self-contained `## Toolchain & check commands` section in `CLAUDE.md`** so they survive the slim-down and flow into `AGENTS.md` on regen (ref: `tapakly/CLAUDE.md`, `ccxt_extract/CLAUDE.md`).
- **Roster doctrine.** Prefer `codex`, `cursor`, `grok`. `claude` is dispatched only when the operator has enabled it in the Agents settings; the default is off because the orchestrator session already runs on the same Max subscription. `cursor` and `grok` are one family — pair either with a `codex` reviewer. Spread assignees across the enabled agents; a ledger skewed to one adapter is the tell. A repo may override the roster in its own CLAUDE.md.
- **Model pins.** `model` is required at creation for any non-`human` assignee (`rmap new` rejects a model-less dispatchable task; see `rmap.md` § "Pinning an LLM model"). Read the live standing model per agent from `routing-brief` and the live ids from `model_availability-list_available_models <agent>`; a retired pin fails at dispatch, so re-pin when you touch a task. A newly-probed model lands in the catalog as `selected?: false` — select it before it is dispatchable. New ids carry no ledger data — route to them to *gather* it (`dispatch-compare`), not on a performance claim.

### Known Sharp Edges

- **Fresh worktrees lack `deps/` / `_build/`.** Implementer and reviewer each run project bootstrap (e.g. `mix deps.get`) when needed — budget timeouts for cold worktrees.
- **Reviewer runs the checks.** No mechanical check stack. Correct-but-not-pristine work → reviewer fixes and approves (`reviewer_diff_size` > 0).
- **Cold dialyzer PLT** dominates first reviewer check run in Elixir worktrees.
- **Nested Claude auth.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` shadows subscription OAuth — scrub per run (`scrub_anthropic_key: true` or `env: %{"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" => false}`).
- **Parallel-session rmap mutations** during a run can false-positive `:checkout_polluted` — wait for the wave or use a separate worktree.

# Worktree-Per-Branch Workflow

Run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel without files landing on the wrong branch. The mechanic: every new branch gets its own worktree under a centralized location, named after a tracking ID, cleaned up when the work merges.

**Scope:** local laptop only — Claude Code on `~/_DATA/code/<repo>/`. Cloud-delegation worktrees (Codex `codex/...`, Cursor `cursor/...`) are governed separately by `delegation-rules.md`, `agent-dispatch.md`, and `agent-pr-review.md`.

## When to Create a Worktree

**Trigger: any branch-worthy work.** Whenever Claude would otherwise run `git checkout -b <new-branch>`, create a worktree instead.

✅ Worktree warranted:
- Starting a new feature, fix, refactor, or experiment that will become its own PR
- Working on a `[P]` parallel ROADMAP task while another session is on a different branch
- Picking up a Linear issue, ROADMAP task, or scoped fix

❌ No worktree needed:
- Tiny in-place fix on the currently checked-out branch (typo, doc tweak)
- Read-only exploration / investigation / answering questions
- Running tests, builds, or quality checks against the current state

## Naming — Use a Tracking ID

Pick the worktree ID in this preference order:

1. **Linear issue** — `MW-247`, `INE-5` (when the work is tracked in Linear)
2. **ROADMAP task number** — `task-42` (local-only work tracked in `ROADMAP.md`)
3. **Branch name** — `fix-auth-redirect`, `experiment-cache-layer` (ad-hoc work)

The ID becomes both the worktree directory name AND the branch name (or a sensible derivation — branch can be `feat/<id>-<slug>` if convention dictates).

## Location — Centralized

```
~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>/
```

- `<repo>` = repo basename (matches `~/_DATA/code/<repo>/` directory name)
- `<id>` = the tracking ID from above

**Why centralized:** sibling-of-repo (`~/_DATA/code/<repo>-<id>/`) clutters `~/_DATA/code/`; in-repo (`<repo>/.worktrees/<id>/`) gets traversed by `ripgrep` / `mix deps` / file watchers. A dedicated top-level dir is easy to grep for orphans (`ls ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/`) and stays out of every other tool's path.

## Commands

```bash
# Create — branch + worktree in one step
git worktree add ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id> -b <branch>

# Existing branch (e.g., picking up someone else's WIP)
git worktree add ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id> <branch>

# List active worktrees in the repo
git worktree list

# Remove (after PR merge / branch deletion on remote)
git worktree remove ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>
git worktree prune
```

To start working in a new worktree, open a fresh Claude Code session in that directory: `claude` from `~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>/`.

## After PR Merge — `audit-review` Is Deferred

`review:audit-review` catches hygiene drift (extractions, doc gaps, missing TODO markers, ROADMAP/CHANGELOG drift) that pre-commit `code-review` may have skipped, writes `.audit/<sha>.md` reports, and lands one `audit(...)` commit on the default branch.

**Not chained off `gh pr merge`.** The post-merge tail ends at branch cleanup. The `review` plugin's SessionStart hook (`check-unaudited-commits.sh`, ≥3 unaudited threshold) surfaces accumulated tails next session:

```
/review:audit-status        # read-only snapshot of unaudited commits per branch
Skill(audit-review) <range>        # batched audit over the accumulated range
```

`<range>` is typically `<last-audit-sha>..<default-branch-HEAD>` — one batched pass covers all merge SHAs since the last audit.

**Manual override:** `/review:audit-review [<sha>|<range>]` for catch-up audits, batch passes, or compliance asks.

**Tiny-commit fast path.** For commits ≤100 LOC AND no `lib/` (or language equivalent) touched, the skill skips Codex dispatch and writes a `verdict: clean — fast-path` report. No separate skip flag needed; if every commit in the range is fast-path-eligible, the audit is cosmetic and ends in seconds.

**Why deferred, not chained.** Bots (CodeRabbit, Copilot, Codex's GitHub bot) run between PR-open and merge, so auditing pre-bot risks re-auditing. The audit commit lands on the default branch where it's durable. Batching N merges into one pass is strictly cheaper than N synchronous passes, and `.audit/<sha>.md` artifacts indexed off merge SHAs in default-branch history remain the canonical inspection surface.

## PR Auto-Merge — Set It When You Open

When opening a PR from a worktree, immediately wire up GitHub-native auto-merge:

```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
gh pr merge <N> --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

GitHub holds the merge until all required checks pass (CI green + `block-merge-gate / gate` clean — i.e. no `[BLOCK-MERGE]` label present) AND no requested-changes review state. No Claude / cloud-agent invocation pre-merge — the gate is GH-native.

**To hold a PR for manual review before merging:** `gh pr edit <N> --add-label "BLOCK-MERGE"`. Remove the label to release.

Full adoption guide: `plugins/review/templates/auto-merge.md` (branch protection setup, `block-merge-gate.yml`, optional auto-undraft action).

## Lifecycle — Cleanup Is Part of Completion

**The work isn't done until the worktree is gone.**

Cleanup trigger: PR merged to base (auto-merge fires from § "PR Auto-Merge"), or feature branch deleted from remote.

```bash
# Same session that completes the PR merge:
git worktree remove ~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>
git worktree prune
git branch -d <branch>  # if local branch still around
```

If you forget and later notice an orphan (worktree exists, but `git branch -vv` shows the branch as merged or `[gone]`), run the same removal commands. Orphan accumulation is what motivated the original worktree ban — keeping the directory tidy is the price of admission.

## Git Operations in a Worktree

`git commit` / `git push -u origin <branch>` / `gh pr create` on the worktree's own branch are ordinary parts of the work — do them without asking. The worktree's HEAD is the feature branch by construction, so commits land on the right branch by design.

❌ **Still confirm first (irreversible / outward, not ordinary-commit gating):**
- `gh pr merge` (governed by `delegation-rules.md` § "DON'T AUTO-MERGE PRS")
- Force-push, amend published commits, rebase **already-pushed** shared history
- `git push` to a cloud-agent's branch (governed by `delegation-rules.md` § "NEVER PUSH TO A CLOUD-AGENT'S BRANCH")

**Mental model:** commit / push / PR-create are free. The only gates left are the irreversible/outward ones — merge, history-rewrite, cloud-agent branches.

## What NOT to Do in a Worktree

- **Don't open IEx / Tidewave from a worktree.** Use the host project (`~/_DATA/code/<repo>/`) for runtime exploration. IEx in the worktree creates a parallel `_build` and recompile churn that races with the host session. Mirrors the `agent-pr-review.md` § "Tidewave is verification, not necessarily fix" constraint.
- **Don't create a worktree for read-only exploration.** Read files in-place from the main checkout. Worktrees are for branch-worthy work that will produce commits.
- **Don't commit from a non-worktree path** (the main checkout) when the work belongs to a feature branch. If you find yourself about to `git checkout -b` from the main checkout, stop and create a worktree.

## Per-Repo Override

A project can opt out of the worktree workflow by pinning a memory file under `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/feedback_no_worktrees.md`. Local memory always wins over global rules. Use this only when the project genuinely requires direct work on a single shared branch (e.g. a thin extraction tool with one active line of development).

## Elixir Project Setup

Standard dependencies and tooling for Elixir projects (libraries, CLI tools, escripts).

### Recommended Dependencies

| reach | PDG/SDG — `reach.check --arch --smells` architecture + smell gate (see `reach.md`) | Always |

### Version Pinning

Pinned versions below are starting points. Before adding a dep, check hex for current:
```bash
curl -s https://hex.pm/api/packages/<pkg> | jq -r .latest_stable_version
```
Hex `~>` operator (per `Version.match?/2`):
- `~> X.Y` allows everything up to (not including) the next major: `~> 2.0` = `>= 2.0.0 and < 3.0.0`; `~> 0.3` = `>= 0.3.0 and < 1.0.0`.
- `~> X.Y.Z` allows everything up to (not including) the next minor: `~> 2.0.0` = `>= 2.0.0 and < 2.1.0`; `~> 0.3.1` = `>= 0.3.1 and < 0.4.0`.

For 0.x packages, every minor bump can be breaking under hex semver — so prefer the three-segment form (`~> 0.3.1`) when you want to lock to a single 0.x minor and opt into bumps deliberately.

### mix.exs deps (libraries/non-Phoenix)

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:ex_unit_json, "~> 0.6", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:dialyzer_json, "~> 0.2", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:styler, "~> 1.4", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:credo, "~> 1.7", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:dialyxir, "~> 1.4", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:ex_doc, "~> 0.40", only: :dev, runtime: false},
    {:doctor, "~> 0.23", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:tidewave, "~> 0.5", only: :dev},
    {:bandit, "~> 1.10", only: :dev},      # non-Phoenix only
    {:ex_dna, "~> 1.5", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    # reach 2.8.x still declares `ex_ast ~> 0.12.0` upstream. Override it rather than
    # pinning back to 0.12 — reach only uses APIs ex_ast 0.13 retains, verified against
    # `mix reach.check` (bourse, tapakly, zen_websocket; six more repos run the same pair).
    {:ex_ast, "~> 0.13.1", override: true, only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:ex_slop, "~> 0.4", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:reach, "~> 2.8", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
    {:descripex, "~> 1.0"},               # full dep — macros expand at compile time
    {:api_toolkit, "~> 0.1"}               # API services only
  ]
end
```

### Required: cli/0 for preferred_envs

Mix doesn't inherit `preferred_envs` from deps. Without this, `mix test.json`/`mix dialyzer.json` run in `:dev`:

```elixir
def cli do
  [preferred_envs: ["test.json": :test, "dialyzer.json": :dev]]
end
```

**Gotcha:** `preferred_envs` only fires for top-level Mix invocations. **Inside an alias step it's ignored** — the step inherits the parent alias's env (usually `:dev`). To run an alias step in `:test`, wrap with `cmd`: `"cmd MIX_ENV=test mix test.json ..."`. See § "Standard Aliases" below.

**Second gotcha — an exported `MIX_ENV` beats `preferred_envs` entirely.** `cli/0` only applies when `MIX_ENV` is *unset*. `MIX_ENV=dev mix precommit` (or a shell that exported it once) runs the whole gate in `:dev`; on a Phoenix app `ash.setup`/`ecto.setup` then targets the dev database and the failure surfaces as a **Postgres authentication error** — it reads like broken credentials, not a wrong env (observed on a dispatched run; only the reviewer traced it back). Say it before the first expensive step:

```elixir
@test_env_guard ~s(sh -c '[ -z "${MIX_ENV:-}" ] || [ "$MIX_ENV" = test ] || { echo "This gate runs in MIX_ENV=test via cli/0 preferred_envs, but an exported MIX_ENV=$MIX_ENV overrides that. Run: env -u MIX_ENV mix <task>" >&2; exit 1; }')
# first step of any alias declared `:test` in cli/0:
"cmd " <> @test_env_guard
```

Mix does not export `MIX_ENV` into `mix cmd` subprocesses, so the guard reads the ambient shell value, not Mix's resolved env. The `"cmd MIX_ENV=test mix test.json ..."` form in the aliases below is immune (it sets the env explicitly) — the guard matters for aliases that *rely* on `preferred_envs` (Phoenix `precommit: :test`, `ci: :test`).

### Formatter

Add `Styler` to `.formatter.exs` plugins: `plugins: [Styler]`.

**Styler sets your Elixir floor to 1.17.** It rewrites `DateTime.add/3` into `DateTime.shift/2` whenever the running Elixir is ≥ 1.17, so `mix format` writes 1.17-only calls regardless of what `elixir:` claims. Declare `elixir: "~> 1.17"` (or higher) — a lower floor is a build that only works by accident.

### Standard Aliases — four tiers, split by audience

Four tiers, each with a different consumer. The marketplace's `pre-commit-unified.sh` hook runs its **own** inline gate at commit time (format · compile · credo · doctor · sobelow · mix_audit · ash — **no tests, no dialyzer, no ex_doc**); it does **not** invoke these aliases. The aliases are for manual / dispatch / CI runs. (`mix docs` belongs in CI / a manual run — too slow for any gate.)

| Alias | Consumer | Adds | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `check.fast` | you, after every meaningful edit | format · compile-with-warnings · credo | seconds |
| `precommit` | you, before handoff | + doctor · test+cover gate · sobelow | tens of seconds |
| `check.dispatch` | harness reviewers — the registered `check_command` | + `ex_dna --max-clones 0` · `sobelow --exit Low` | tens of seconds |
| `precommit.full` | CI / `harness.yml` / post-wave integration run | + dialyzer · `reach.check --arch --smells` | minutes |

```elixir
defp aliases do
  [
    # TagTODO/TagFIXME stay on in .credo.exs for visibility (`mix credo` shows them);
    # the gate excludes them so it fails only on real regressions, not tracked debt.
    "check.fast": [
      "format --check-formatted",
      "compile --warnings-as-errors",
      "credo --strict --ignore TagTODO,TagFIXME"
    ],
    # Manual pre-handoff gate (NOT run by the commit hook). No dialyzer; tests + sobelow + doctor.
    precommit: [
      "check.fast",
      "doctor --raise",
      # `preferred_envs` (cli/0) is ignored for alias steps — set MIX_ENV explicitly.
      "cmd MIX_ENV=test mix test.json --quiet --cover --cover-threshold 85 --summary-only --exclude integration",
      "sobelow --skip"                 # --skip honors inline # sobelow_skip; drop on pure libs
    ],
    # Dispatch-scale gate: what a harness reviewer runs against a task's worktree.
    # ex_dna is here, not in precommit.full, because it runs in ~1s and a clone introduced
    # by a dispatched run is otherwise invisible to the per-task gate (observed in practice).
    "check.dispatch": [
      "precommit",
      "ex_dna --max-clones 0",
      "sobelow --skip --exit Low"      # web-facing apps only; drop on pure libs
    ],
    # Full gate — adds the whole-suite invariants that need a graph or a PLT.
    "precommit.full": [
      "check.dispatch",
      "dialyzer.json --quiet",
      "reach.check --arch --smells"
    ]
  ]
end
```

Each tier calls the previous one, so a step appears once and the ordering (cheapest-fail-first) is preserved by construction. Register `check.dispatch` as the harness `check_command`; `precommit.full` is what CI runs and what the post-wave integration run on landed `origin/<target>` uses.

**Flag rationale:**

- **`credo --strict --ignore TagTODO,TagFIXME`.** TODO/FIXME are tracked-debt visibility (`development-philosophy.md` § "TODO Comment Requirements"), not regressions. Standalone `mix credo` still surfaces them so an agent can SEE the debt; the gate doesn't fail on them so PRs aren't blocked by accumulated tags. ExSlop rides this step as a Credo plugin — no separate alias entry (see § "ExSlop" below).
- **`doctor --raise`.** Overrides `.doctor.exs` `raise: false` to gate CI without changing local behavior. Redundant if the repo already sets `raise: true`, but harmless. A `doctor` dep without a `doctor` alias step is a dead gate — the dep alone enforces nothing.
- **`test.json --cover --cover-threshold 85 --summary-only --exclude integration`.** 85% is the project default (cartouche's empirical floor; meaningful bump from 80%, leaves headroom under typical ~87% project coverage). Critical-path repos (signing, money, crypto, wire-format encoders) raise to `95`. `--exclude integration` because the credentials/network for live services are not present in a normal run; run the integration tag separately where they are. **The threshold must live in the alias, not only in `AGENTS.md` prose** — a coverage tier enforced by telling the agent about it is not enforced.
- **`ex_dna --max-clones 0`.** Zero-tolerance clone gate. Placed in `check.dispatch` because it costs ~1s and per-task review is the only point where a freshly introduced clone is visible before it lands. Generated/vendor clones: configure ExDNA ignore paths, don't relax the threshold.
- **`sobelow --skip`** (precommit) / **`sobelow --skip --exit Low`** (check.dispatch). `--skip` makes sobelow honor inline `# sobelow_skip` annotations (without it they're ignored — see "Sobelow skip/config semantics" below). `--exit Low` fails on Low-confidence findings too: `Low` is the only threshold that catches `Traversal.FileModule` on an operator-supplied path, and every committed skip is Low or Medium, so nothing below Low exists to suppress. Phoenix / Plug / web-facing apps only — drop both steps on pure libraries. A `.sobelow-conf` needs no flag — it auto-loads since 0.14.1 (`--no-config` opts out).
- **`dialyzer.json --quiet`** (precommit.full). Agent-friendly JSON variant (agents prefer JSON over the human-readable default). For pipeline parsing: `dialyzer.json --quiet --output /tmp/dialyzer.json` then jq.
- **`reach.check --arch --smells`** (precommit.full only). Needs the full SDG — too slow for the inner loop or the dispatch gate. `--arch` validates against `.reach.exs`; `--smells` runs the cross-function smell surface (see `reach.md` for the Credo overlap). An empty `.reach.exs` (`[]`) is a valid no-policy — `--arch` passes vacuously until you populate layers/boundaries, so populate it as the architecture settles.

**Never put `format` (the rewriter) in a gate.** `format` mutates the tree; `format --check-formatted` checks it. A `ci` alias that runs `format` and then `format --check-formatted` can never fail on formatting — the check verifies what the previous step just wrote. Gates check; humans and hooks rewrite.

**Sobelow skip/config semantics** (source-verified against 0.15.0 tarball 2026-08-09, `nccgroup/sobelow`; flag behavior drifts across versions — re-check before relying):

- Inline `# sobelow_skip [...]` annotations are honored **only with `--skip`** — bare `mix sobelow` ignores them (`lib/sobelow.ex`: `if get_env(:skip), do: combine_skips(...), else: funs`).
- The `.sobelow-skips` *fingerprint* file (written by `mix sobelow --mark-skip-all`) is *read* unconditionally but **suppresses findings only with `--skip`** (`lib/sobelow.ex` `loggable?/2`: `!(get_env(:skip) && (new_skip || legacy_skip))`) — one flag gates both mechanisms, inline annotations and the skip file; a plain `mix sobelow` prints skipped findings by design. Matching uses only the hash column; the `Type,file:line` prefix is display/sort metadata — but the line number feeds the `phash2` input (`[type, vuln_source, filename, vuln_line_no]`, `lib/sobelow/finding.ex`), so a line shift still invalidates the entry via a changed hash.
- `.sobelow-conf` (written by `--save-config`) **auto-loads by default since 0.14.1** (`config = Keyword.get(opts, :config, true)` in `lib/mix/tasks/sobelow.ex`); `--no-config` opts out. **CLI args take precedence** over conf values (`Keyword.merge(config_settings(conf_file), opts)`) — so `mix sobelow --format json` keeps JSON output regardless of the conf's `format:`. 0.15.0 additionally drops action keys (`version`, `details`, `all_details`, `save_config`, `diff`) from the conf with a warning — a checked-in conf can no longer make the scanner exit without scanning. (Pre-0.14.1 behavior was the reverse: conf only with `--config`, and it replaced CLI opts.)
- `--mark-skip-all` **rewrites `.sobelow-skips` merged + deduped + sorted as of 0.15.0** (`--legacy-skips` restores the historical append-only mode). It still never removes entries that no longer match a live finding, so the prune cadence for stale-entry bloat remains `rm .sobelow-skips && mix sobelow --mark-skip-all`.
- Therefore: to honor inline skips, pass `--skip`; a `.sobelow-conf` needs no flag. The marketplace pre-commit hook always passes `--skip` for this reason; its `--format json` is safe with or without a conf since the CLI wins.

**Why four aliases, not one.** The commit hook enforces a fast inline gate (no tests, no dialyzer) so the inner loop stays cheap and deterministic. Each further tier adds exactly the checks its consumer can afford: the dispatch reviewer gets the clone + security gate without paying for a PLT; CI gets the graph and PLT invariants once per wave. Keeping them separate means the slow steps run where no inner-loop tax applies — never blocking every commit.

Why no `try/rescue` aggregator by default: an agent that wants "all failures in one pass" can override at the call site (`mix format --check-formatted; mix credo --strict --ignore TagTODO,TagFIXME; mix test.json ...` joined with `;` runs every step regardless of exit). The default alias stays fail-fast because the cheapest-fail-first ordering means the agent rarely needs the aggregate — fixing the first failure usually unblocks the rest.

### Tidewave (Non-Phoenix)

Three files must agree on PORT. Registry: `~/.claude/tidewave-ports.md`. MCP registration is **project-scope** only (`.mcp.json`) — never user-scope; local/user scope collides across projects.

1. `~/.claude/tidewave-ports.md` — registry row
2. `mix.exs` alias:
   ```elixir
   tidewave: ["run --no-halt -e 'Agent.start(fn -> Bandit.start_link(plug: Tidewave, port: PORT) end)'"]
   ```
3. `.mcp.json` (project root):
   ```json
   {"mcpServers":{"tidewave":{"type":"http","url":"http://localhost:PORT/tidewave/mcp"}}}
   ```

Run with `iex -S mix tidewave`. Restart Claude Code after creating/changing `.mcp.json`. Check scope with `claude mcp get tidewave`; remove user/local if present.

### Tidewave Recompile Gotcha

Tidewave runs in the same BEAM as the IEx session. After editing source, the old bytecode stays loaded — call `recompile()` via `project_eval` (or `r(SomeModule)` for one module). For the full MCP tool list, see the `tidewave-guide` skill.

### Dialyzer PLT — `:apps_direct` to avoid OOM

Default `plt_add_deps: :app_tree` walks the full transitive dep tree. For libraries / non-Phoenix projects, tidewave + bandit (dev) drag in plug, finch, mint, gun, hpax, cowlib, thousand_island, websock, mime — none of which are in `lib/`'s call graph. PLT bloats to ~800 modules and on macOS routinely OOM-kills the build at the deps-dev step (verified: peak RSS ~8 GB before kill).

Per dialyxir docs, the canonical OOM mitigation is `plt_add_deps: :apps_direct` — load only **direct** runtime deps, no transitive recursion:

```elixir
defp dialyzer do
  [
    # OOM mitigation: skip transitive deps (default is :app_tree).
    # Tidewave/bandit's HTTP stack (plug, finch, mint, gun, cowlib, etc.)
    # is not in lib/ call graph and bloats PLT to ~800 modules.
    plt_add_deps: :apps_direct,
    plt_add_apps: [:mix],
    plt_local_path: "priv/plts",
    plt_core_path: "priv/plts",
    ignore_warnings: ".dialyzer_ignore.exs"
  ]
end
```

**Verified result** on a typical onchain-stack lib (onchain_evm): 794 → 236 modules in deps-dev PLT (~70% reduction), full PLT build in 18.6s vs OOM-killed at ~10min.

**PLT location: `priv/plts/` not `_build/dialyzer/`.** PLTs in `_build/` get nuked on `mix clean` / `rm -rf _build`. Every cleanup costs a 5-10min from-scratch rebuild. `priv/plts/` survives `_build` wipes. Add `/priv/plts/` to `.gitignore`. To migrate: `find _build/dialyzer priv/plts -name '*.plt' -delete 2>/dev/null` then `mix dialyzer --plt`.

**Trade-off ladder** (per dialyxir docs):

| Option | Aggressiveness | When |
|---|---|---|
| `plt_ignore_apps: [:foo]` | Least | A few specific deps cause warnings or PLT bloat |
| `plt_add_deps: :apps_direct` | **Moderate — recommended default** | Transitive HTTP/SDK trees cause memory issues |
| `plt_apps: [explicit list]` | Most | Surgical replace; you know exactly what to include |

`:apps_direct` plus `plt_add_apps:` for any specific extras (`:mix`, `:descripex`, etc.) covers the typical library case. For project-specific optional stacks the lib doesn't call (e.g. cartouche's `:google_api_cloud_kms, :goth, :tesla, :jose`), layer `plt_ignore_apps:` on top.

**Phoenix exception:** Phoenix apps use bandit/plug at runtime and depend on transitive deps (Ecto adapters, etc.). Default `:app_tree` is usually correct; only switch to `:apps_direct` if memory is a problem, and verify no real warnings get suppressed.

**Runtime-Req exception:** if your lib has `{:req, "~> X.Y"}` as a runtime dep (not just dev-via-tidewave), `:apps_direct` excludes Req's transitive HTTP stack (finch, mint). Usually fine — Req-call warnings get suppressed via `~r/Function Req\./` in `.dialyzer_ignore.exs`. If "function unknown" warnings about Finch/Mint surface, either add them via `plt_add_apps: [:finch, :mint, ...]` or extend the regex.

### ex_doc llms.txt

`mix docs` generates `doc/llms.txt` alongside HTML — Markdown optimized for LLMs. Published packages have it at `https://hexdocs.pm/<package>/llms.txt`. Use for loading library context.

### ExDNA — Duplication Detection

```bash
mix ex_dna                            # scan for duplicates (Type I — exact)
mix ex_dna --literal-mode abstract    # Type II — catch renamed variables
mix ex_dna --min-similarity 0.85      # Type III — near-miss (structural similarity)
mix ex_dna --min-mass 50              # only flag larger clones
mix ex_dna --max-clones 10            # CI budget — exit 1 only above threshold
mix ex_dna --format json              # machine-readable
mix ex_dna --format html              # self-contained browsable report
mix ex_dna --format sarif             # GitHub Code Scanning
mix ex_dna.explain 3                  # anti-unification breakdown of one clone
```

Config: `.ex_dna.exs` in project root. Suppress intentional dupes with `@no_clone true`. Credo integration: add `{ExDNA.Credo, []}` to `.credo.exs`. LSP server pushes diagnostics to Expert/ElixirLS.

### ExSlop — Credo Plugin for AI-Slop

Prepend to `.credo.exs`: `plugins: [{ExSlop, []}]`. Runs inside every `credo --strict` step — no alias entry of its own. Typical relaxations: `{ExSlop.Check.Readability.NarratorDoc, false}` on projects that keep narrative moduledocs by design. Full check list, categories, and `vibe_kit`'s auto-patcher: `ex-slop.md`.

### Reach — Architecture Gate

`.reach.exs` at project root drives `reach.check --arch` (layers, forbidden deps/calls, boundaries, effects). Start with `[]` and populate as the architecture settles — an empty policy passes vacuously. Gate lives in `precommit.full` only (needs the full SDG). Full CLI (`reach.map` / `reach.inspect` / `reach.trace` / `reach.otp`), the smell catalogue, and the `.reach.exs` key reference: `reach.md`.

### ExAST — AST Search & Replace

```bash
mix ex_ast.search 'IO.inspect(_)'           # find debug leftovers
mix ex_ast.search 'IO.inspect(...)'         # ellipsis — any arity
mix ex_ast.replace 'dbg(expr)' 'expr'       # remove dbg, keep expression
mix ex_ast.replace --dry-run old new        # preview
mix ex_ast.diff lib/old.ex lib/new.ex       # syntax-aware diff
```

Patterns: `_` = wildcard, named vars (`expr`) capture and carry to replacement. `...` = zero-or-more (args, list items, block body). Structs/maps match partially. `_` in function-name position of `def`/`defp` patterns matches the function name even when arguments are present (e.g. `defp _(_), do: _` matches `defp helper(x), do: x + 1`). The `piped()` selector predicate distinguishes form inside the `~p`/`where` DSL — `where(piped())` matches only `|>` calls, `where(not piped())` matches only direct calls. `ExAST.search_many/3` and `ExAST.Patcher.find_many/3` run multiple named patterns in a single traversal, returning matches tagged with `:pattern`. See `development-commands.md` for the full surface (pipe awareness, `--inside`/`--not-inside`, multi-node, `~p` sigil, quoted patterns, AST/zipper input).

### Quality Gates

- Dialyzer: 0 warnings (mandatory)
- Credo: 0 issues in `--strict`
- Doctor: all public modules documented
- Tests: 85%+ coverage (95% for critical business logic) — gated in the alias, not in prose
- ExDNA: 0 clones (`--max-clones 0`)
- Reach: `reach.check --arch --smells` clean against `.reach.exs`

## Agent Economy Design

Every app and library should treat AI agents as first-class consumers. Design for discovery, calling, and verification now.

### Tier 2: Self-Describing with Descripex (default)

`descripex`'s `api()` macro generates `@doc`, `@doc hints:`, compile-time validation, and runtime introspection from a single declaration:

```elixir
use Descripex, namespace: "/funding"

api(:annualize, "Annualize a per-period funding rate.",
  params: [
    rate: [kind: :value, description: "Per-period funding rate as decimal", schema: float()],
    period_hours: [kind: :value, default: 8, description: "Hours per funding period", schema: pos_integer()]
  ],
  returns: %{type: :float, description: "Annualized percentage rate", schema: float()}
)

@spec annualize(number(), pos_integer()) :: float()
def annualize(rate, period_hours \\ 8), do: ...
```

**What `api()` generates at compile time:**
- `@doc` (BEAM slot 4) + `@doc hints:` (slot 5) — human-readable + machine-readable
- `@moduledoc namespace:` — URL grouping
- `__api__/0`, `__api__/1` — runtime introspection
- `schema:` — Elixir type syntax compiled to JSON Schema via json_spec
- Param names validated against function args

**Manual `@doc` coexistence:** Place `api()` *before* an existing `@doc`. Hand-written `@doc` overwrites only slot 4 (prose); slot 5 (hints) survives. Standard for annotating existing codebases. For multi-clause functions, place `api()` before the first clause only.

**Variable opts → `emit_api/3` (v0.11+):** `api/3` preprocesses `schema:` keys at expansion and so requires a *literal* keyword-list `opts`. To declare apis in a `for`-comprehension or with macro-time variable opts (e.g. generating N declarations from a method table), use `emit_api(name, desc, opts)` — same emissions, skips preprocessing (caller pre-converts any `schema:`). It raises `ArgumentError` on literal opts, steering you back to `api/3`.

**Param kinds (the key distinction agents need):**
- `:value` — caller provides (number, date, config)
- `:exchange_data` — must be fetched first; include `source: "fetch_trades(symbol)"`

**Two modes: using and understanding.** Agents call the public API (using) *and* debug why something happened (understanding). Both need rich metadata. Annotate internal infrastructure too — a reconnection failure needs `describe(:reconnection)` to expose `calculate_backoff/2` and `should_reconnect?/1`. Public/internal is a documentation grouping concern, not a discoverability depth concern.

### Manifest & Progressive Disclosure

Flow: `api()` → compile-time `@doc` + `hints` → `Code.fetch_docs/1` → `Manifest.build(modules)` → consumed by HTTP endpoint / static JSON / MCP tools / A2A cards.

**App wrapper:**
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Manifest do
  @modules [MyApp.Funding, MyApp.Risk, MyApp.Options]
  def build, do: Descripex.Manifest.build(@modules)
end
```

**Progressive disclosure:**
```elixir
defmodule MyApp do
  use Descripex.Discoverable, modules: [MyApp.Funding, MyApp.Risk]
end

MyApp.describe()                     # L1: modules, namespaces, function counts
MyApp.describe(:funding)             # L2: function list (name, arity, spec, description)
MyApp.describe(:funding, :annualize) # L3: full detail — params, returns, errors
```

Short names: last module segment lowercased (`MyApp.Funding` → `:funding`). Non-Descripex modules get basic listings. Or use `Descripex.Describe.describe/1-3` directly.

**MCP tool generation:**
```elixir
Descripex.MCP.tools([MyApp.Funding, MyApp.Risk])
# => [%{name: "funding__annualize", description: "...", inputSchema: %{...}}]
```
`name_style: :full` for fully-qualified names. Serve the list from your MCP endpoint.

**Validation test:** walk all public modules, assert every exported function has `:hints`. Without enforcement, hints rot.

### Consuming Descripex-Powered Libraries

Use structured discovery instead of reading source. Contracts are compile-time validated — if it compiles, they're accurate.

- **Detect:** `Code.ensure_loaded?(SomeModule) and function_exported?(SomeModule, :__api__, 0)` (same for `:describe, 0`) — `function_exported?/3` answers `false` for a module that simply has not been loaded yet, which under lazy loading makes an annotated module look unannotated
- **Discover:** `MyLib.describe()` / `.describe(:funding)` / `.describe(:funding, :annualize)` — Level 3 has everything needed to call correctly (param order, kinds, defaults, return shape, errors, composition hints)
- **Direct module access:** `Module.__api__()` / `.__api__(:func)` — `hints` has the same fields as Level 3
- **Batch:** `Descripex.Manifest.build(modules)` — JSON-serializable map of the whole API
- **Type-coverage audit:** `Descripex.typeless_params(modules)` — every `kind: :value` param still shipping without a JSON Schema, tagged `:no_spec` / `:no_type_info` / `:unconvertible`. Only `:unconvertible` is actionable; gate CI on it

See the library's `CONSUMING.md` for exact output shapes.

### Tier 3: Trustless Verification (EIP-8004 ecosystem)

[ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) defines three registries — Identity, Reputation, Validation. The manifest bridges code to all three: validators read it to understand contracts, re-execute with the same inputs, and compare results.

**Static export:** `mix descripex.manifest [--app my_app] [--pretty] [--output PATH]` generates `api_manifest.json`. Ship as static artifact, reference from EIP-8004 registration.

**Design for verifiability:** pure functions re-execute trivially; stateful ops need input/output logging for replay; side effects need receipts/attestations. The more pure your core, the easier trustless verification.

### What Belongs Where

| Concern | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Param hints, response shapes, errors | `@doc` metadata in library |
| Namespace, module grouping | `@moduledoc` metadata |
| Composition hints | `@doc` metadata |
| Tier/pricing, rate limits, authentication | API layer (not library) |
| EIP-8004 registration | Agent wrapper project (Ethereum coupling stays separate) |


- **Reviewer note**: `mix test.json` (`ex_unit_json`) and `mix dialyzer.json` (`dialyzer_json`) emit JSON **by design** — parse for real failures, never flag the envelope. Canonical gate is `mix ci` / `mix precommit.full`. See `AGENTS.md` § Toolchain & check commands.

## Project Overview

**DeltaCalc** — a standalone, **headless** `Decimal` calculation engine for leveraged crypto
trading: position sizing, effective leverage, liquidation price, DCA ladders, safety scoring,
and spot hedging. Salvaged from the retired `TradingDashboard` app so a rebuild depends on this
library instead of reimplementing the math. **No Phoenix, no Ecto, no I/O** — pure value-in /
value-out functions.

### Scope Boundary — delta_calc Owns Reconcilable Money, zen_quant Owns Estimates

`zen_quant` (`~/_DATA/code/zen_quant`, on Hex) is a sibling analytics library with no
dependency relationship in either direction, and the two are split **by numeric regime, not
by topic**:

- **delta_calc owns anything that must reconcile against an exchange balance** — money,
  margin, fees, hedge sizes, lot-quantized order quantities. `Decimal`, because a number
  the operator compares against a venue statement may not carry float error.
- **zen_quant owns anything that is an estimate** — option pricing, implied vol, greeks,
  skew, vol estimators, risk ratios, orderflow, signals, sizing *fractions*. Float.

**The split is forced, not stylistic.** `Decimal` has no `exp`, `ln`, or `erf` — so
Black-Scholes, IV solving and the volatility estimators **cannot** be implemented here, and
an attempt to add them means either a wrong answer or a float sneaking into a `Decimal`
library. Send that work to zen_quant instead.

**Before adding a function here, ask which side of that line it falls on.** The two overlap
*conceptually* in about a dozen places (funding APR, basis, PnL, concentration, liquidation
distance, stress tests, max loss, position sizing) — that overlap is intended, because each
side answers it in its own regime. Three public names already exist in both by design:
`max_loss`, `realized_pnl`, `unrealized_pnl`.

One overlap resolves into a pipeline rather than a duplicate: `ZenQuant.Sizing.kelly`
answers *which fraction*, `DeltaCalc.PositionCalculator.calculate_position` answers *which
exact quantized size*. Prefer that shape over reimplementing either end.

## Architecture & Conventions

- **Pure `Decimal` only** — never floats for money/price/leverage.
- **Module surface** (ported task-by-task, see roadmap): `DeltaCalc.Calc` (core engine),
  `DeltaCalc.Presets`, `DeltaCalc.DCAPlanner`, `DeltaCalc.PositionCalculator`, `DeltaCalc.Hedging`.
- **Agent surface (Descripex):** annotate **every** public function with `api(name, desc, opts)`
  immediately before its `@doc`, **at port time** — not as a backfit. `:value` param kind for
  money/price/leverage inputs. `DeltaCalc.Manifest` + `Descripex.MCP.tools/1` aggregate the surface.
- **Source of truth for ports:** the retired app at `~/_DATA/code/TradingDashboard`
  (`lib/trading_dashboard/risk/*.ex`, `portfolio.ex` + `portfolio/snapshot.ex` hedging formulas,
  `test/trading_dashboard/risk/*.exs`).

## Dispatch Roster — codex only (repo override)

All harness-dispatchable tasks in this repo route to **`assignee = "codex"`, `model = "gpt-5.6-sol"`** —
overriding the global spread-across-adapters default. Rationale (2026-08-09, waves 38/45/39): both
grok-4.5 runs needed reviewer fixes (incl. an unsafe dynamic-atom bug and a forbidden CHANGELOG edit)
while codex delivered the largest lib-wide task fix-free; ledger shows codex at 44.6% vs grok at 27.4%
first-attempt-pass. In a `Decimal` money-math library, reviewer-fix churn on lib code is the wrong place
to save tokens. Re-pin any task filed with a different assignee when you touch it.

## Roadmap

`roadmap/tasks.toml` is canonical (`rmap` renders `ROADMAP.md` + `roadmap/data.json`). Phases 1–2
and milestones `v0_1`–`v0_2` are complete. Phase 3 and milestone `v0_3` are the active focus.
Use `rmap ready` for the dispatchable set and its declared write-sets before parallel dispatch.

## Quality Gate

`mix ci` (format, compile `--warnings-as-errors`, test, `credo --strict`, dialyzer,
`ex_dna --max-clones 0`, `reach.check --arch --smells`). Coverage tiers: ≥80% standard,
≥95% on `Calc`/`Hedging` money math.

## Review Blind Spots — Encode What Per-Task Review Can't See

The harness reviewer grades **one diff against one task**: mechanical checks (credo/dialyzer/
coverage), the task's stated acceptance criteria, and internal consistency. It cannot see two
things, and real correctness bugs landed clean through both gaps (tasks 24/25/26):

- **Domain ground truth.** A hardcoded venue constant (`@funding_periods_per_day 3`, an 8h-interval
  assumption that overstates Deribit's hourly funding ~8×) is internally consistent, fully tested,
  and passes every check — because the golden test was computed *with* the wrong constant, so
  coverage ratifies the bug instead of catching it. The reviewer has no signal the value is wrong;
  that knowledge lives in the consumer's head. **Fix: push domain invariants into acceptance
  criteria** — e.g. "no venue-specific constants; funding cadence / fee tier / interval is a
  caller-supplied `:value` param." Then the reviewer *can* reject the hardcode.
- **Cross-module global invariants.** Write-set-disjoint parallel dispatch means two modules can
  each define `project_payback_timeline` in separate worktrees and neither review sees the other —
  the name collision only surfaces at the consumer. **Fix: the manifest-consistency test**
  (`mix ci`) asserts public name+arity uniqueness across all registered modules, full module
  registration in `DeltaCalc.Manifest`, and the `:hints`-present invariant. Turn global invariants
  into CI failures, not consumer discoveries.

Rule of thumb: if a defect can only be caught by knowing the *domain* or seeing the *whole surface*,
no per-task reviewer will catch it — encode it as an acceptance criterion or a manifest-wide test.

## Domain Invariants — The Load-Bearing Truths a Per-Task Reviewer Can't See

These are the cross-cutting domain rules that every module must honor and that no single-diff
review can verify. They are **enforced as executable assertions** in
`test/delta_calc/domain_invariants_test.exs` (run by `mix ci`), computed independently of the
formulas under test — never re-asserting current output. State them here so the cross-family
reviewer (which reads `AGENTS.md`, generated from this file) can reject a diff that violates one.
When a new invariant is discovered, add it both here and as a test; the test is the gate, this list
is the rationale.

- **Funding rate is a fraction, everywhere.** Every funding-rate `:value` input across the surface
  is a decimal fraction (`0.0001` = 0.01%), matching `Funding`/`Carry`/`Hedging` — the canonical
  convention. No module may treat the same numeric rate as a percent and divide by 100 internally.
  The same rate fed to two modules must give dimensionally consistent results, not a silent 100x.
- **Raw→daily scales by ×periods, in one direction.** `daily = raw_per_period × periods_per_day`,
  so a raw threshold expressed on a daily basis is **larger**, not smaller. Any raw→daily
  conversion (arbitrage threshold, `min_delta` normalization) multiplies by periods; a `÷periods`
  on this conversion is the bug.
- **No baked-in venue constants in generic math.** Funding cadence, MMR tier schedules, fee tiers,
  and kill-switch thresholds are caller-supplied `:value` params. Any default left in place is
  documented as a convention and is overridable — proven by a test feeding a non-default value.
- **Goldens are independently sourced.** High-risk formula fixtures (liquidation, sizing, DCA, fees,
  funding) assert against values computed *outside* the code under test — hand-computed, from a
  spec, or external reference — with documented provenance, compared as `Decimal` with explicit
  tolerances (never `to_float`). A golden derived from the same formula proves consistency, not
  correctness, and ratifies any constant error baked into the formula.

**Pending invariants** (target post-fix state for an open roadmap task) are tagged
`@tag :domain_pending` and excluded from the default run so the harness bundle stays green; they are
real red assertions, not `assert true`. Run them with `mix test --include domain_pending` to watch
each go green as its task lands — the fixing task's acceptance criteria include removing its tag.
Each carries a `TODO(Task N)` inside its `flunk/1` message, so a pending assertion names its owning
roadmap task at the point it fails. The task ID is required — a bare `TODO` is not enough to place
the work. Credo's `TagTODO` stays enabled and does not see these: it scans comments and docs, not
string literals, so the tracked markers cost nothing while real untracked TODOs in comments still
get flagged.

## AGENTS.md is generated — regenerate after editing CLAUDE.md

`AGENTS.md` is **not** hand-authored: it's the Codex-facing view of this file, produced by
inlining every `@`-import from `CLAUDE.md` (Codex doesn't inherit our Claude Code hooks, so
AGENTS.md carries the rules they'd enforce). After any `CLAUDE.md` edit, regenerate:

```sh
~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/zenhive/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh          # write
~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/zenhive/scripts/sync-agents-md.sh --check  # freshness gate (CI)
```

Never edit `AGENTS.md` directly — it's overwritten. Both files are committed; `--check` exits
non-zero when AGENTS.md has drifted (including drift in transitive `@`-imports).

## Tidewave

This library runs Tidewave via a **standalone Bandit** endpoint (no Phoenix). Start it with
`mix tidewave` (port **4024**); the `.mcp.json` `tidewave` server points there. `harness` MCP is
the harness dashboard at `:4018` for roadmap ingest/dispatch.

## Dependency Gotchas

### decimal 3.x — default context precision changed (28 → 34)

Bumped `decimal` `~> 2.0` → `~> 3.0` (2.4.1 → 3.1.1) on 2026-06-17 (forced by `doctor` 0.23.0, which requires `decimal ~> 3.1`). Breaking changes vs 2.x:

- **Default `Decimal.Context` precision is now 34 (decimal128), was 28.** Division and other precision-bound ops carry MORE significant digits by default. When porting calc logic from the source project (whose reference values were computed under 2.x), **expect division/rounding results to differ at the trailing digits** — golden/snapshot values captured under decimal 2.x may not match. Set an explicit context or `Decimal.round/2,3` at output boundaries rather than relying on the default precision.
- `Decimal.parse/1` and `Decimal.cast/1` now reject inputs with >34 digits or absolute exponent >6_144. Realistic trading figures never hit this; pass `max_digits: :infinity` / `max_exponent: :infinity` to the `/2` arity if a genuine giant value is ever needed.
- `Decimal.to_string/2,3` raises on output >6_178 digit chars (Inspect/String.Chars/JSON.Encoder bypass it). Irrelevant to this domain.
